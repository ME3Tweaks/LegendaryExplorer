		<String id="704526">Maybe those texts will help the asari remember how to fight again.</String>
		<String id="704527">No, the problem is that our people are terrible at making war!</String>
		<String id="704528">The Library at Asha had sacred texts on the ways of the huntress--the defining works on the art of battle.</String>
		<String id="704529">But the Nimbus Cluster has already fallen, and our people are here dancing instead of fighting.</String>
		<String id="-2146779118">-1</String>

		<String id="704542">Really? Thank you, Earth-Clan!</String>
		<String id="704543">Were your people involved in a secret construction project of some sort, I am certain this obelisk would help.</String>
		<String id="704544">Please tell the primacy that the Vol Protectorate wishes to assist with the Alliance project.</String>
		<String id="704545">We had a Prothean Obelisk that might have helped. Sadly, it was lost in the Shrike Abyssal.</String>
		<String id="704546">Nevertheless, we are committed to helping both the Turian Empire and the Human Alliance.</String>

		<String id="704558">Maintain, my brothers and sisters--we have faced adversity, and overcome. This is but a test!</String>
		<String id="704559">Remember the pillars of strength that hold our people high. Show the galaxy our resolve!</String>
		<String id="704560">I know that your faith is weak. Our government has fallen. But if you hold the pillars of strength in your hearts...</String>
		<String id="704561">Please... just don't give up.</String>

		<String id="704572">That's... wonderful! Thank you!</String>
		<String id="704573">My people will treat this miraculous find as a call to support their local hospitals.</String>
		<String id="704574">No, I'm seeing it here, too. We're low on medi-gel and synthetic blood, and we don't have enough volunteers.</String>
		<String id="704575">If we could get the Rings of Alune from the Silean Nebula, we could declare a cultural crisis. People would have to listen.</String>
		<String id="704576">They're not just symbolic. The asari revere Alune. She wore these rings after learning medicine from Athame herself.</String>
		<String id="704577">She was like a dalatrass for your people. If we displayed her rings, we'd get more asari support in the hospitals.</String>

		<String id="704590">Yes! Thank you! I'll call them right now!</String>

		<String id="704592">Prothean ruins! On Gei Hinnom in the Hades Nexus!</String>
		<String id="704593">If you could get past the Reaper patrols, I'm sure you'd find something valuable!</String>
		<String id="704594">That's got to be worth something! Please, my family is starving!</String>

		<String id="704607">Listen, I thought of something. No, it can't wait until I'm back on duty.</String>
		<String id="704608">The Hesperia Period. Their statues had legendarily accurate Prothean inscriptions. Can we use that?</String>
		<String id="704609">Yes, I know the Athena Nebula is off-limits, but this... a classified project. It needs all the Prothean intel we can find.</String>
		<String id="704610">I haven't found any reliable pictures, but just think... If those statues had something that could help us, even today...</String>

		<String id="704631">It's not that simple! If we aren't careful about this now, we'll end up losing everyone!</String>
		<String id="704632">Then we'll find a way. Look, we have more... fortunate patients, right?</String>
		<String id="704633">Yes. And I hate to say it, but the fortunate ones have far better survival odds.</String>
		<String id="704634">And more credits. So we ask them for... donations. To get more supplies. For those without credits.</String>
		<String id="704635">What? Are you saying what I think you're saying? That's... you know, actually, that might work...</String>
		<String id="704636">Who are we to choose who lives or dies? That's not what we do. We help our patients--all of them.</String>
		<String id="704637">That's a nice sentiment, but it won't help when we run out of supplies. I've seen this happen in combat before.</String>
		<String id="704638">And we will run out of supplies. Have you seen the projections the administration center made?</String>
		<String id="704639">I have. The situation is going to get worse. What's your point?</String>
		<String id="704640">We can't deny the facts: if we prioritize them, some of our patients are in a much better position to survive.</String>
		<String id="704641">If we take care of them first and ration our supplies, we can save some now... and enable ourselves to save more later.</String>
		<String id="704642">We cannot do that! We swore an oath: to help the sick, regardless of their economic situations or their places in society. </String>

Klencory is famously claimed by the eccentric volus billionaire Kumun Shol. His once-ridiculed visions of "beings of light" protecting organic life from synthetic "machine devils" don't seem quite so far-fetched now. His private army of mercenaries are well-established on the planet, waiting for husks to come knocking on their door. In all likelihood, they will be obliterated by the molten metal of a Reaper orbital bombardment, on its way to somewhere important.

		<String id="704986">Sesmose is an ice dwarf world, its surface composed almost entirely of frozen water. Normally a planetoid this small would not rate inclusion on the system's charts, but Sesmose's unusually large and beautiful ring of ice crystals has made it a popular subject for visual artists.

This ring is the result of a glancing equatorial impact, which left a large "trench" and threw a large amount of melted water into the atmosphere. The rings are a temporary feature that will completely decay in a few thousand years.

		<String id="705295">A little cooking. Hope you don't mind, I was craving some of my abuela's huevos rancheros.</String>
		<String id="705296">Not sure what kind of eggs these are, but they seem to work.</String>
		<String id="705297">Oh, if you see Ash anywhere, tell her I'll save her some.</String>
		<String id="705298">I'm thinking she might need a little nourishment after last night.</String>
		<String id="705299">We just needed to unwind a bit. She's a fun girl when she actually lets down her hair down for a minute.</String>
		<String id="705300">Mmm! Not as good as my abuela's, but best thing I've had since I got on board.</String>
		<String id="705301">Maybe it's best I don't know what kind of eggs these are, no?</String>

		<String id="705324">I mean, I knew they were still out there, but seeing is definitely believing, if you know what I mean.</String>
		<String id="705325">Sounds like you guys had a crazy ride over there.</String>

		<String id="705332">Yeah, your quarian friend. The jumpy one with the glowing eyes? Sparks.</String>
		<String id="705333">Crazy that they pick now to start a fight, but I guess the end of life as we know it can make everybody a little loco.</String>

		<String id="705379">Yeah. He was the reason I joined the marines and was about the only good thing in my life after my mom died.</String>
		<String id="705380">He's there... somewhere. But I'm not sure I'd call him family. Not anymore.</String>
		<String id="705381">I would like to find out how my uncle's doing, though.</String>

		<String id="705387">But I get it now. It's not where I'd be most useful. Not yet, anyway.</String>

		<String id="705390">Besides, I like to keep Esteban on his toes!</String>
		<String id="705391">Yeah, Esteban did a stint on Fehl Prime where me and my squad were stationed.</String>
		<String id="705392">I caught up with him back on Earth a few months back. He's a good guy.</String>
		<String id="705393">Just don't tell him I said so. It'll go to his head.</String>
		<String id="705394">It's just my way of remembering people.</String>
		<String id="705395">Some people just don't match their names, you know? So I just give 'em a new one.</String>
		<String id="705396">Yeah, I mean... I'm pretty crazy, but the shit you've done? Makes me look sane.</String>
		<String id="705397">Yeah, my best friend's sister growing up was Lola. Older sister. Hot. Tough.</String>
		<String id="705398">You bet.</String>
		<String id="705399">Sure.</String>
		<String id="705400">I'll be here.</String>

		<String id="705470">I wonder what the hell Cerberus was up to on Sur'Kesh.</String>
		<String id="705472">Parts of Tuchanka reminded me of the desert back home. The lizards and worms are bigger, but you know... the sand and everything.</String>
		<String id="705473">You think that cure they dispersed could do anything to us? We're not gonna start growing scales or anything?</String>
		<String id="705474">Maybe now that we have the krogan on board, we can go back to fighting the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="705475">I was looking at the specs on that Reaper you took out on Tuchanka. That was one of the small ones!</String>
		<String id="705476">Don't get me wrong, it's still dead, but damn... there was nothing small about it.</String>
		<String id="705478">Three-hundred years it took to take back the quarian homeworld. I sure as hell hope it doesn't take that long for us.</String>
		<String id="705479">The geth machines took over the quarian's homeworld and never gave it back. Let's hope it goes better for us against the Reapers.</String>

		<String id="705692">The commander's right. It's not like those Reaper things care about hurting civilians.</String>
		<String id="705693">But selling weapons to just anyone makes it easier for groups like Cerberus to get ahold of them!</String>
		<String id="705694">Cerberus attacked the Citadel with military-grade weapons and powered armor. I doubt they need one of my pistols.</String>

		<String id="705702">Rules be damned, people have a right defend themselves.</String>
		<String id="705703">If you start selling weapons to everyone on the Citadel, C-Sec will shut this whole place down.</String>

		<String id="705705">You think a court is going to want more people running with guns right now?</String>
		<String id="705706">Then I'll go to the Wards and sell from the back room at Purgatory.</String>

The Turian Hierarchy put Menae in the hands of the military soon after their spacecraft first landed on the moon, immediately halting civilian research and exploration. Menae's geological composition and specifications have been classified ever since. These days, a few active naval bases dot the moonscape, as well as infantry installations focused on extreme survival training.

The mystery of Menae is a lasting fascination for many turian citizens. Speculation about its presumably rare and valuable resources has become a common plot point in vids, novels, and even poetry for young turians.</String>

		<String id="705961">Like the geth plasma shotgun, the Spitfire is not a true energy weapon. Instead, the minigun magnetically flings clusters of superconducting toroids. These donut-shaped projectiles are designed to shatter upon impact, arcing electricity between the fragments and flash-converting them to plasma. The gun's punishing, automatic blasts impact with the heat of a cutting torch.

The weapon's stopping power has garnered the attention of both Alliance and quarian intelligence, who theorize that the Spitfire may have been designed to destroy other geth. Enough Spitfires have been found in the field to suggest that the weapon is out of the prototyping stage, and that a schism among synthetics may have forced them into production.</String>

Along with most of the second Normandy's crew, Dr. Chakwas was kidnapped by the Collectors and taken beyond the Omega 4 relay, where Commander Shepard eventually rescued her. 

After the Alliance impounded the Normandy SR-2, an inquiry found that Dr. Chakwas had "no significant role in or provable knowledge" of Cerberus's criminal activities. She has since rejoined the Alliance.</String>

During her Pilgrimage--a rite of passage in which quarians prove their worth to the fleet--she recovered a geth memory core that proved a rogue Spectre, Saren Arterius, was working with the geth. As a consequence, Tali'Zorah became a crew member of the SSV Normandy, where she served under Commander Shepard during the Battle of the Citadel.

Tali'Zorah returned to the Migrant Fleet following the destruction of the first Normandy. Soon after, the Admiralty Board sent her to the former quarian colony of Haestrom to recover data on the planet's dying sun. Most of her team was killed when they fell under attack from the geth, but Tali'Zorah herself was narrowly rescued by Shepard and the crew of the rebuilt Normandy.

Quirezia's orbit places it within the system's frost line, where gas giants do not usually form. For this reason, the planet is believed to be an extrasolar capture.

During the Krogan Rebellions, a warlord named Graken Dhal took the fight to Palaven's home cluster, bombarding the modestly defended Digeris. When reinforcements came to intercept him, Dhal's navy put their rear to Digeris so that stray shots would hit the planet. The turians won despite this severe handicap, using countless fighters and cruisers to take down the krogan dreadnoughts.

Today, the turian fleet holds Digeris in a stalemate. The Reapers, concentrating on Palaven and elsewhere, sent a relatively light force to take the planet, which the turians repelled. The turians stand guard at Digeris while the Reapers travel throughout the system, destroying targets of opportunity until reinforcements arrive.

Suen was the site of the last battle in the Rachni Wars. When krogan forces bombarded the planet, the rachni abandoned their surface buildings for the security of their tunnels. The krogan, resistant to Suen's toxic atmosphere, carried weapons of mass destruction into the secret chambers of the rachni queens and detonated explosions so powerful the sinkholes are still visible today.

We've lost people due to recent events: some resigned because of the attack on the Citadel, and some quit to go find their families or loved ones. While we can only wish them the best, we nonetheless find ourselves in a precarious position, as retaining experienced personnel is now an issue.

Recruitment efforts have been given due attention, but should you know of any potential candidates, please refer them to the head of recruitment as quickly as possible. </String>

Toli,

I've got the names of the officers we lost during the Cerberus attack on the Citadel who had relatives in your sector. Some of my people asked me to include personal letters for some of them. I've added a recording of my own for each, as well. If you could deliver those at the same time as you notify the families, we'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Bailey</String>

Kar,

There's no way Cerberus should have been able to drop a damned Atlas on us during that little visit of theirs. I got an idea as to how they might have pulled it off, though.

Check the files on all the shipping companies, go back as far as needed. See who has the biggest cargo weight versus inspected goods discrepancies. I'm thinking someone may have "lost" a shipping container at some point, and that's where that Atlas came from.

Attempts are ongoing at figuring out what the end product of our research was meant for. While it is obvious that the delivery system was to be implant-reliant, with evident neurological applications, many questions remain as of yet unanswered. The loss of Dr. Horace Armstrong in particular is hindering our efforts to speedily reconstruct the nature of the Illusive Man's goals.

Although most of Kashshaptu is composed of silicate minerals, the rachni made an important discovery when they charted "the howling gulf," an enormous crater near the planet's equator. The depression was caused by the impact of several dozen extrasolar asteroids containing large quantities of element zero. The rachni took samples of the new element back to Suen for further study.

Centuries later, when the rachni captured the Citadel expedition that opened the relay to their system, their research on eezo helped them reverse-engineer the ships' FTL drives. The rachni built faster-than-light vessels of their own and rapidly expanded beyond their own stars.

This rare environment means that the volus have been slow to colonize, as there are few planets that meet their habitation requirements. Most prefer to stay on Irune, working remotely via the extranet. The more adventurous don the clumsy but vital pressure suits and venture out to worlds in Citadel space to make their fortunes.

Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Volus culture lacks the romantic view of war found in the galaxy's more aggressive species. Physical skirmishes between groups rarely last long, and are almost always ended by social castigation, bargaining agreements, or harsh economic sanctions. 

Irune's cities tend to be built on fast trade routes rather than militarily defensible positions. This has left them vulnerable to husk attack now that the Reapers have overwhelmed the turian fleets and begun a ground war on the planet.

CITADEL TRAVEL ADVISORY: Irune's ammonia-based atmosphere is toxic to non-volus life-forms. Visitors to Irune must wear pressure suits at all times when traveling outside of environmentally controlled areas.

		<String id="706727">Benning, the nearest garden world to Arcturus Station, is the primary source of its food supply and an important staging area for starship maintenance and repair. Occupying the planet would be key in any attempt to retake the system's relay.

Scattered intelligence indicates that during the battles of Arcturus and Earth, the Reapers sent a small force to Benning to destroy its comm buoys, spaceports, and starships. With the population immobilized and communications cut, the main force concentrated on the larger prize, knowing they could return before repairs could be made or help could arrive.

Heat sources in Benning's space indicate a non-Reaper presence here.

It presented the turians with an interesting engineering challenge: how to mine its abundant heavy metals and get them off the high-gravity planet without requiring so much fuel or eezo that it ruined the profit margin. As a result, the Hierarchy heavily subsidized these mining concerns, in return for retaining large stores of gold, iridium and niobium for their strategic reserve.

Sensors report a large Reaper force of capital ships and destroyers here, which have chased off Fiax's defenders. Interestingly, they seem to have captured several of the orbital stations intact rather than turn them to slag.

A vast array of solar collectors absorb energy from the star and beam it to receptors near the tidally locked asteroid's terminator zone. Beneath the surface, dozens of particle accelerators generate antiprotons for starship fuel.

The Reapers sent a substantial force to Gemmae's system but found that the turians were capable and prepared to defend their armada's fuel source. Warning messages say the Reapers are still present in the system, awaiting reinforcements. At present, the turians can still refuel--but only because they committed forces here that could otherwise have defended Palaven.

		<String id="707572">Khar'shan, the batarian homeworld, is wrapped less in mystery than in outright lies. Batarian propaganda claims the world has 15 billion inhabitants and an economy that rivals the asari. Although the legal slave trade does boost the batarians' profits somewhat, Citadel sanctions have left a paper tiger of an empire, one that fights rivals through deniable terrorist actions rather than the wars of its heyday centuries ago.

The Reapers will likely be the death blow to that empire. Almost no information has escaped Khar'shan since the Reapers destroyed the comm buoys, but batarian refugees say that resistance has created a bond among the commoners. If a new government can rise from the ashes, that bond may sustain a new batarian society.

		<String id="707573">Verush is a hydrogen-helium gas giant named for an ancient batarian monarch whose empire spanned continents. He had such a penchant for mating that 0.6 percent of modern batarians claim to trace their lineage to him. 

The planet's moons are named after his many recognized wives. The largest, Bira, concealed Prothean ruins that helped the batarians develop FTL travel. It is a batarian point of pride that, since the ruins were damaged by earthquakes, they had less information to go on than other spacefaring species.

The Reapers have destroyed all obvious military outposts in Verush's orbit. The batarians' notorious secrecy, however, may have allowed concealed subterranean facilities on Verush's moons to survive.

		<String id="707574">A tiny rock and ice planet that is now missing much of its ice, Ilem was part of a grand project by a Hegemony dictator known as Grebosht the Mad. His aim was to drop enormous chunks of Ilem's ice on the surfaces of otherwise uninhabitable desert planets in the hopes of creating sustainable lakes and seas. Wiser heads than he pointed out that diverting a comet was more plausible, but Grebosht executed those who disagreed with him. Grebosht's career was surprisingly long given his loose grip on reality, mostly because his projects employed large numbers of batarians.

Today, Ilem lies abandoned. Hegemony spy drones still orbit the planet, but it is doubtful anyone on Khar'shan is paying attention to what data they send back.

Indoctrinated batarian officials are offering rewards for every living body brought to the labor camps, slave or not. With the state apparatus at their disposal, Reaper units are coordinating house-to-house hunts for resistance members, and paying those who turn them in. Government propaganda dismisses the smell of the processing ships as a natural byproduct of Reaper energy consumption. Columns of dust from annihilated cities tell the story of those who disobeyed.

The discs explode on impact, sending shrapnel tearing through the enemy. Markings stamped on the gun's barrel are a shipping code created by its manufacturer, Ama-Lur Equipment. The code warns that the rifle must be assembled carefully, as it contains mixtures extremely volatile under pressure. This is why the Chakram Launcher requires thermal clips: without a way to dissipate the intense heat caused by its fabrication process, the rifle's circuitry would quickly destroy itself in a spectacularly lethal meltdown.</String>

Their best proof of this last point is Ezka, which closely orbits the scorching yellow-white star Untrel. Ezka's nitrogen-heavy atmosphere might once have held oxygen, but if so, it burned off long ago. Even robo-miners don't care for Ezka--although some modern mining equipment can withstand the heat, the machinery still gets stuck in the soup of molten light metals on the planet's surface. 

Reaper presence near Ezka seems light. Scans reveal wreckage orbiting the planet, likely destroyed Hegemony surveillance drones.

The planet also has an abundance of sodium oxide, used in the manufacture of lye, but profit margins on that compound are thin by comparison.

The Reapers have destroyed the orbital stations surrounding Klos and cut the strands of the space elevators that earlier generations of batarians used to transport goods to orbit.

The Hegemony colonized Adek early in its expansion, but few of the colonists wanted to stay. The result was domination by a class of landed slave-owners. A small cadre of well-paid engineers and skilled laborers kept the planet's mechs and infrastructure functioning. 

Alliance estimates put the planet's batarian population at just over six million, but that number has likely fallen since the Reapers arrived.

		<String id="709436">The Krogan Rebellions began in the asari colony of Lusia. After centuries of unabated expansion, the krogan finally forced the Council's hand when they tried to annex this world. Aware that in a generation, Lusia could be a staging base for an invasion of Thessia, the Council came to the colony's defense. They cut the krogan supply lines off at Thessia's mass relay and inflicted heavy casualties. The krogan here surrendered, but others across the galaxy were enraged. Lusia became the catalyst for a much greater war.

More than a millennium later, Lusia finds itself once again in danger. Though the asari have lost the "high ground" of space, the colony's webbed defense grid remains at least partially functional. Land, sea, and air forces are striking wherever they can, determined to resist until the end.

During the Lusia campaign that started the Krogan Rebellions, Niagolon was the site of krogan Overlord Kredak's ultimate defeat. As his flagship was discharging its drive core and undergoing repairs, an asari commando team snuck on board and detonated resonant warp bombs, sacrificing their lives to destroy the vessel through explosive decompression.

		<String id="709441">Pronoia is a methane-ammonia gas giant, notable for the large deposits of platinum discovered by Lusia colonists on its largest moon. Asari have been selling the precious metal, used in some medical equipment, to the Sirta Foundation for less than its market value. The discount may have single-handedly saved Sirta from bankruptcy, a debt that is rapidly being repaid galaxy-wide through Sirta's humanitarian efforts. The Reaper presence in the system has no doubt cut off supplies to the foundation.

The only real features of note are empty calderas scattered around the fault lines, suggesting Thissioni was once more geologically active. While average temperatures are near-habitable, Thissioni has not retained a protective atmosphere and is thus a third-tier world unlikely to be terraformed.

		<String id="709450">Niacal is a lush planet with an overabundance of photosynthetic life, leading to oxygen concentrations greater than on most garden worlds. This is tolerable for a few hours, but soon oxygen toxicity becomes a real danger. Asari colonies here use breathers and sealable buildings. 

Niacal's economy centers on agribusiness and biotechnology. Many genetically modified crops have their origin here.

Aware that the Reapers' plan of attack is to bombard industrial cities and enslave population centers, Niacal's soldiers and civilians alike have retreated to the planet's impenetrable jungles. A terrestrial guerilla war may not be enough to push the Reapers off the planet, but it has proven successful at immobilizing the enemy and forcing them to commit more resources here for little gain.

		<String id="709452">After half the crew of a survey ship died in a freak accident, the ship's captain named this desert planet Kralla, after an ancient asari demon of misfortune.

Kralla is said to delight in thwarting carefully laid plans at the last moment, tipping apparent success toward utter disaster. Legend says she only targets those whose plans are long in the making, an obvious warning against hubris for a race whose plans tend to stretch over centuries.

Collecting and refining the eezo in dust form is a long and costly process. The Elkoss Combine sought the mineral rights to Egalic from the matriarchs on Thessia, but the Reaper invasion stopped any deal from going through. The equipment here is undamaged by Reapers--the attack on Niacal likely taking priority.

Large tracks of untamed forest surrounding the capital drew in millions of sightseers, game hunters, and biologists. The asari, mindful of how rapid expansion has damaged the ecologies of other planets, restricted settlements.

After destroying the colony's navy and antiair defenses, Reapers landed infantry units to subjugate the local population. Destroyers keep watch in orbit, the capital ships apparently elsewhere fighting bigger battles.

		<String id="709570">Trikalon is a small rock planet that was home to a centuries-old asari venture called the Tirii Supercollider. This massive particle accelerator encircled the entire planet at an orbital distance. When political sea change among the Asari Republics led to funding cuts, human scientists stepped in with the credits and labor to finish the project, renaming it the Susskind Supercollider. It came online just days before the Reapers invaded the galaxy.

When the Reapers entered the system, they dispatched a swarm of capital ships toward Trikalon, treating the supercollider as a greater threat than the asari naval fleet stationed at Sanves. They blasted it apart, sending debris hurtling to Trikalon's surface. Several ships carrying supercollider staff escaped before the Reapers hit.

Trategos's colonists are fighting the Reapers in a guerilla war, their best resource being submarine vehicles that can slip under the sea ice to mask their heat. Unfortunately, these have not proven good tools for taking back population centers from the Reapers, and for now the colonists will have to be satisfied with commando actions to harass their synthetic oppressors.

I don't know how to say this- Udina wants me to be a Spectre. Crazy- I know. I'm not a big fan of Udina, but he can make the Spectre thing happen.

Commander,

Just wanted to pass along I'm settling into my new post with Admiral Hackett. Too many things to get done- not a lot of rack time.

I'm starting to get a handle of the enormity of what we're up against. We get new intel everyday that needs to get processed into practical action. Turns out, I'm good at breaking things down to the practical. No surprises there.

To: Steven Hackett

Admiral Hackett:

Apart from some challenges during their initial integration, we had found the addition of the rachni workers a significant boon to production--until now. 

Perhaps it is a lack of cultural awareness on our part, but recently the rachni have taken to wandering away from their assigned tasks, or even standing motionless for long periods of time. The behavior is unnerving when coupled with our inability to effectively communicate with them. 

I must stress I do not have the luxury of a leisurely timetable on the Crucible Project. Another crew from the Alliance Engineering Corp arrives in six days, and because of these disruptions, we are not ready for them to begin work on schedule. 

We need to find a solution quickly.

Siha, 

I write this with a heavy hand, knowing you will read this letter when I am no longer able to share my thoughts. I am dying, Siha. Perhaps because of the differences between our species, I can hope that time will treat you with kindness and dim the hurt of my passing to faded recollections that a drell would forever remember with perfect clarity. 
Selfishly, however, I could not leave this world without leaving a piece of me behind that would never fade. 

I once accepted my fate. Nothing remained but a shell destined to die. I only had to choose the when and how of my passing. I had refused to be confined to a bed, gasping horribly as my life beeped away to machinery I had no use for. I thought of my Irikah, broken, bloodied, and betrayed by my absence. Of Kolyat, small and afraid, bravely pushing at his eyes to stem the flow of tears I had entrusted to him to cry... for both our sakes. 

The expectation to move swiftly to my end vanished upon uniting with your cause. You awoke me, Shepard. My heart quickened its sluggish beat if only to remain at your side and protect you with everything that I am. I was content to simply watch, take the time left given and praise all I know for allowing me to walk my final days with hope and certainty that I am worthy of more than my cold isolation, solely because you believed.

I love you. If all else whispers back into the tide, know this for fact. By grace given me by the Goddess Arashu, I bid her divine protection to you, my warrior-angel, my Siha, to succeed in your destiny. To light your path through the coming darkness. To give you hope, when all seems lost. 

I will await you across the sea.

Crucible project extremely engaging. Complex parameters, multiple technology evolutions from pre-Prothean cultures likely. Fascinating to see salarian, turian, human forces working together.

Our work on Rannoch continues to go well. The geth left impressive technology and raw materials that we have used to make repairs and return our fleet to fighting strength. While we have focused primarily on providing support for the more fortified turian fleet, we have also been able to evacuate key colonies and hold back Reaper skirmishing forces.

		<String id="709807">From: Alliance News Network Information Partners

Thessia - Asari scientist Rana Thanoptis has died in custody, allegedly committing suicide after she was arrested for the murder of multiple asari military officials. 

Prior to her death, investigators said Thanoptis spoke of voices in her head, which they believed to be indicative of her indoctrination. The voices foretold the ascension of the asari--and told Thanoptis that anyone fighting the Reapers "needed to die."

Thanoptis worked on a top-secret project for former Spectre Saren Arterius several years ago, where she likely became indoctrinated. She received a pardon from the asari government in exchange for providing research assistance on Reaper technology. 

Thanoptis was believed responsible for planting a makeshift explosive device that detonated at a research center, killing five visiting asari military officials along with four civilians. The attack seriously wounded a dozen more and caused significant damage to the facility. 

Investigators say they are not seeking any more suspects in the case.</String>

Elysium - An evacuation shuttle, nearly destroyed as it attempted to escape the Reaper-occupied colony of Elysium, was reportedly saved after a lone biotic worker intervened.

The shuttle was carrying children who drew higher numbers on the colony's evacuation lottery, meaning they were not eligible to board the first wave of shuttles leaving the planet.

Their shuttle was saved when the biotic, identified by authorities as Aresh Aghdashloo, engaged Reaper forces that were preventing it from taking off. Aghdashloo had a history of drug abuse and criminal activity, and claimed to have survived a Cerberus camp on Pragia as a child. 

Witnesses said he killed several dozen Reaper creatures before he was overwhelmed, providing the shuttle just enough time to fly clear.</String>

		<String id="709811">From: Alliance News Network Information Partners

Palaven - The Turian Hierarchy, one of the most powerful and respected ground forces in the galaxy, are today paying respects to an unlikely ally: the marines of the Quarian Fleet.

The weakened immune systems of quarians normally means their forces are restricted to ships. But when an emergency technical team was required to repair a ground-based com relay, providing vital intel to the turian military, one quarian squad stepped up. 

Commanded by squad leader Kal'Reegar, the quarian team repaired the com system, then sacrificed their lives holding the position until krogan troops arrived. 

When turian troops offered to provide evac support, Reegar refused, insisting they could not risk the relay falling. He said multiple breaches to their exo-suits made evacuation impossible. 

"We're all dead anyway," Reegar reportedly said. "Just make them pay for it."

A spokesman for Primarch Victus praised the squad's bravery. 

"Whatever our past politics, today the galaxy stands together against a single threat," Victus said. "We are humbled by the sacrifice of our allies from Rannoch, and we promise to return the honor."</String>

Feros - A group of colonists on Feros have mounted a defensive against arriving Reaper forces, holding them back long enough for civilians from nearby colonies to escape.
 
The informal militia from Zhu's Hope, said to be survivors of a savage geth attack several years ago, has repelled initial Reaper landing attempts with a level of wartime competence more common to seasoned platoons.

The colonies are using improvised weapons, as well as supplies salvaged from a defunct ExoGeni facility. 

"This colony is our home," colony spokesperson Lizbeth Baynham said. "We've survived worse, and we know how to fight together." 

The colony is expected to have time for full evacuation before more Reaper forces arrive.</String>

Dear Commander Shepard:

I don't know if you've seen the articles, but the people of Zhu's Hope are fighting again. This time it's the Reapers instead of the geth. 

I'm not sure if you remember me, but you helped me back on Illium. The Thorian is dead now. I can confirm that. But the spores in our bodies remain, and on some level, we are still connected. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing. As we fight back the Reapers, we feel each other, and act with one mind, ignoring pain when the need arises. I'm sure I'm still indoctrinated. I remember Sovereign's voice in my mind when I went willingly to the Thorian as its thrall. But my connection to the people of Zhu's Hope is stronger. It drowns out the Reaper voices.

This situation is imperfect, and dangerous. Perhaps the colonists should separate, for their own safety. But with one mind, the untrained fight with the skill of veteran commandos. Our force is strong.

I have not forgotten how you helped us, how you spared me. We are leaving Feros soon, and when the time comes, we will fight with you.

Commander, I am deeply disappointed by your actions on Tuchanka. As I thought I made clear, curing the genophage will have long-term consequences. Once the Reaper threat has passed, our combined forces will be so depleted that no race in the galaxy will be capable of stopping a resurgent krogan.

When that day comes, Commander, the blood of my people will be on your hands.

Commander, I am pleased to learn of your decision on Tuchanka regarding the genophage. Reason has prevailed. 

Our remote sensing equipment has detected the cure has failed, and the aerosol you released will not properly inoculate the krogan against further reproductive degradation. Our reconnaissance reveals the krogan are unaware of your actions, and continue to believe the genophage has been cured.

Be warned though, Commander. When this conflict with the Reapers has passed, the krogan will eventually realize something is wrong and may seek explanations. When that day comes, our scientists will supply you with fabricated evidence to prove the cure was flawed from the beginning and had no chance of success. 

In the meantime, I'm pleased to offer you the formal support of the Salarian Union in your efforts to complete the Crucible and turn the tide against the Reapers. After this war is over, we can all rest assured the galaxy will be safer without the threat of further krogan interference.

Commander Shepard, I wonder if you've ever received a message from a ghost? I'm supposed to be dead, correct? I was able to escape Tuchanka without the krogan spotting me, though Kalros gave me a few scares. Damnable planet! I still believe in my heart the krogan deserve a cure, but I do concede that, under Urdnot Wreav's rule, their future would perhaps be even more violent and bleak than it is now. 

I plan on riding the conflict out in some remote colony, helping refugees grow food, doing my own part to provide comfort in this war. There will, I fear, be plenty to keep me busy. I enjoyed knowing you, Commander. Our secret will be safe until the day I die. Only time will tell if we made the right decision.

Commander Shepard! 

I've just heard the news you cured the genophage and that some of the females from my experiments were involved. I can't tell you how good this makes me feel. There hasn't been an hour I've not thought about what happened on Tuchanka and wondered if I did the right thing. This news validates all the pain my experiments caused. I hope one day to meet the females again and ask for their forgiveness. After you convinced Dr. Solus to spare me I took his advice and opened a clinic on Omega. I thought it would help make amends for whatever suffering I caused. I had to leave when word got back to Clan Weyrloc and they put a bounty on my head for failing to deliver a cure. Maybe now they'll leave me alone.

Citadel - A violent confrontation erupted on the Citadel today when Urdnot Wrex, a known krogan mercenary, accosted an Alliance soldier over an unpaid gambling debt. 

Witnesses say that what began as a verbal argument quickly turned into a physical altercation during which the krogan drew his weapon and began firing at the defenseless Alliance soldier. 

C-Sec personnel arrived on scene and were forced to kill the mercenary, ending the tense standoff.

"I can confirm there was an incident which resulted in the fatal shooting of an armed krogan near the loading docks," C-Sec commander Armando-Owen Bailey said. 

"We're still not sure how he smuggled his weapon onto the Citadel or what triggered the fight, but our information suggests it was some sort of bet that didn't pan out. Our investigation is ongoing and until it's concluded, we'll have no further comment."</String>

Cerberus just ambushed a turian cruiser full of high-ranking Hierarchy officials. The cruiser managed to escape, but its location was top-secret. Cerberus couldn't have located that ship without inside information, and the only other person who knew the cruiser's position was volus ambassador Din Korlack. I've heard ugly rumors of a bounty out for his head.

My advisors insist I can't bring these accusations against Korlack myself. I admit they're right. The turian and volus economies are tightly intertwined, and now isn't the time for the political crisis that would result. But the security of our fleets is at stake.

The turians fought the krogan to a standstill, but the sheer weight of krogan numbers indicated they could not be stopped through conventional means. The turians collaborated with the salarians to engineer a genetic counter to the krogan's rapid breeding.

The genophage virus replicated by 'eating' key genetic sequences, altering every cell of krogan physiology so the krogan could not use gene therapy to fix the affected tissues. Once a genophage strain could replicate no more, it would starve and die, limiting mutation and contamination. In addition, the 'created' genetic flaw is hereditary. The resulting mutation made only one in a thousand krogan pregnancies carry to term, reducing offspring viability rather than fertility.

Our father recently contacted me. I don't know if Miranda mentioned him, but he found me, told me he was sorry, told me he wanted to make up for things. He talked about doing important work for humanity, something that could change the course of the war. A huge secret. Now he's taking me somewhere. I'm not sure where. Something doesn't seem right.
Maybe it's nothing, but I'm spooked.

Anyway, when we get to wherever he's taking me, I'll let you know.

Hey, Commander:

Just wondering if you've got some time in the near future. Nothing critical, just wanted to chat.

		<String id="710291">When Dekuuna's government learned that the Reapers had returned, they evacuated everyone on Sangel's helium-3 recovery platforms. The sizable hydrogen-helium gas giant was abandoned, its workers relocated to Dekuuna. The move was ostensibly made because the elcor homeworld was a more defensible position. In reality, it may have been motivated by a subconscious herding instinct, as most grazing creatures come together in large groups when predators near.

		<String id="710293">Atos Irn was claimed, along with the rest of its system, after the volus learned FTL travel. In the great volus exploration push of 300 BCE, the species found only a few planets capable of supporting their colonies. They did, however, discover many planets teeming with valuable elements. 

The orbiting robo-mining platforms of Atos Irn have since been shot through by the Reapers. Little remains except the occasional bit of space debris posing a navigation hazard.

		<String id="710318">Solu Paolis</String>
		<String id="710319">Solu Paolis's helium-3 collection mechanisms historically turned a large profit, not because of any great immigration into the Esori system, but because Solu Paolis made a good refueling stop between Irune and Satu Arrd.

Warned of the Reapers' battle plans but left with little other option, a select team of workers at Solu Paolis sent out phony communications suggesting that important military data was being handed off here. When the Reapers sent in a force of husks, they ran into the volus's trap: a chain reaction that annihilated the station.

The casinos took bets on how long Lahu storms would last and how high their wind speed might climb. Payouts made the rare volus rich, with jackpot winners forming a small fraternal order.

The Reapers have destroyed the satellites.

Oma Ker's spaceports and major roads were blasted into craters by the Reapers, largely immobilizing the population. Its turian defenders are slowly being pushed back by ground forces.

		<String id="710689">Terminus Systems</String>
		<String id="710690">The Systems Alliance, the representative of Earth and all human colonies in Citadel space, claims these territories. Earth has increased its holdings more than tenfold since the discovery of the Charon Relay linked humanity to the rest of the galaxy. Humanity's aggressive expansionism has triggered conflicts with several neighboring species and their governments, most notably the Batarian Hegemony. Despite this, the Systems Alliance shows no signs of slowing its growth.</String>
		<String id="710691">This territory includes the salarian, turian, volus, and hanar homeworlds, as well as the Citadel, the heart of Council space. The Citadel receives a constant influx of diplomats, military officials, major corporate shareholders, and others who seek to do business at the seat of galactic governance. Council races provide peacekeeping ships that patrol Inner Council space, but they use diplomacy or other peaceful means to settle most disputes in this area of the galaxy.</String>
		<String id="710692">Outer Council space contains the asari and elcor's home planets. While the elcor content themselves with their home system and a handful of colonies, the asari have settlements across the territory. Easily the most economically powerful sector of the galaxy, the asari worlds use their financial clout to keep the galactic market stable. Their military fleets patrol shipping lanes and colony space against smugglers arriving via relays from the Attican Traverse.</String>
		<String id="710693">The Attican Traverse is a large territory on the edge of "civilized" space. Connected by an extensive collection of relays, its colonies are often raided by the neighboring Terminus Systems. As habitable planets in the galaxy are scarce, the colonies persevere despite these attacks. The Attican Traverse is littered with Prothean ruins, which attract archeological expeditions determined to unlock the secrets of this advanced technology.</String>
		<String id="710694">The Terminus Systems are an area of space uncontrolled by the Citadel. A refusal to relinquish independence is all that unites its numerous colonies, gangs, and factions. People of all species flock here to make their fortune outside the Council's regulations. As a result, the Terminus Systems are a profitable haven for pirates, mercenary groups, and slavers.</String>

A military-grade version of this equipment was presented to longtime Knight fans at the Alliance's Rhode Island base, in thanks for their passionate (and vocal) support during the EUCC championship matches. Beneath this armor's medieval-gothic facade lie a host of biofeedback systems intended to monitor the wearer's health and combat performance. Micro-servos maximize damage done in close-quarters combat, while a beefed-up power cell feeds energy into weapon systems to increase projectile velocity. Befitting gear originally designed for a full-contact sport, a sophisticated shield system also offers the wearer solid protection from incoming attacks.</String>

The Defender's storage compartments are designed to hold spare thermal clips, while capacitors throughout the armor provide extra power to shields during critical moments in battle.

Volus robo-miners descended on Poloh Tem when element zero was first discovered there, and in turn, pirates descended on the volus. The pirates then found out, to their detriment, that wealthy volus can buy a lot of influence in the Turian Hierarchy.

The Reapers occupied Poloh Tem's orbital stations rather than destroy them outright. It is possible that element zero is rare enough that the Reapers harvest it--but it is more likely that the Reapers are stationing ships here in case the turian forces they drove off seek to recapture it.

		<String id="711402">Phantoms are agile Cerberus agents with a wide array of offensive and defensive capabilities, including particular specialization in evasive maneuvers and firing from cover. Although intelligence on their implants still evades the Alliance, phantoms are known to be able to create a personal barrier for greater protection.

Monomolecular blades and biotic shielding allow phantoms to engage in close-quarters combat, and phantoms can briefly cloak in order to recover from injuries. Because of this ability, the Alliance recommends personal confirmation of a phantom's death.</String>

		<String id="711404">The nemesis is a Cerberus sniper specialist. Customized implants allow the nemesis to withstand the crippling kickback of the M-98 Widow antimateriel rifle, turning a redoubtable opponent into a force capable of inflicting instant death. A suite of high-tech scanning equipment makes the sniper adept at maintaining cover, meaning a nemesis is usually spotted only after opening fire--assuming the target survives the first round. 

Because of self-destruct mechanisms that activate upon the sniper's death, the Alliance has never retrieved an example of nemesis augmentation technology. This fact, combined with Cerberus forces' penchant for suicide when faced with capture, has made scientific study of their implants impossible.</String>
		<String id="711405">Cerberus: Nemesis</String>
		<String id="711406">Guardians, the Cerberus equivalent of human tanks, are slow-moving soldiers who carry enormous polycrystalline-composite shields. The weight of the shield requires an armored suit equipped with hydraulic assists and a dedicated power supply. Combining this exceptional protection with a suite of enviro-mapping systems, guardians focus on flanking opponents to flush them from cover. 

A Guardian's slow but relentless approach is intended to demoralize enemies as well as draw their fire, but rip away their shield, and guardians become little more than cannon fodder.</String>
		<String id="711407">Cerberus: Guardian</String>
		<String id="711408">Cerberus combat engineers are specialized support units that assist primary forces while staying out of the line of fire. They wear lighter armor than the typical Cerberus combatant, using a modified mesh that allows greater mobility. Under cover and out of sight, engineers focus on setting up and maintaining turrets as well as repairing mechanical units or armored allies. When confronted, they return fire only for as long as it takes them to find cover again and let front-line combat personnel take over.

Although engineers are not particularly dangerous on their own, the Alliance specifically warns troops to remain alert for turrets, which can mow down an entire squad while the engineer escapes.</String>

		<String id="711410">Centurions are Cerberus's front-line tacticians. They are meant to enact the Illusive Man's strategic goals, although it is clear that they have leeway to adapt as an encounter develops. 

The only useful intelligence that the Alliance has gathered on centurions relates to their armament. Each centurion carries an M-96 Mattock heavy rifle modified to launch smoke grenades, leaving enemies vulnerable to crossfire.</String>
		<String id="711411">Cerberus: Centurion</String>
		<String id="711412">With the Atlas, Cerberus's research arm has combined the deadly armor and firepower of a YMIR mech with the tactical superiority of a trained human pilot. An element zero core allows the Atlas to be air-dropped onto a battlefield with minimal impact damage. Its thick armor includes a robust transparent canopy made from a polycrystalline composite proprietary to Cerberus. Alliance engineers hypothesize that the material is some kind of synthetic sapphire composed with interlayers to resist cracking and thermal damage. 

Although the Atlas is somewhat unwieldy in the field, its antipersonnel machine guns and ability to shrug off damage from anything short of a heavy weapon makes it a fearsome opponent. Heavy loss of life is to be expected in any unprepared encounter with this unit.</String>
		<String id="711413">Cerberus: Atlas</String>
		<String id="711414">Assault troopers are the backbone of Cerberus forces. Those candidates who make it through the grueling basic training are submitted to an intensive psychological program that renders them fearless, disciplined, and unrelenting. Outfitted with custom-designed armor and rifles, these soldiers function with determined precision and practiced teamwork.

The first to rush into a fight, assault troopers often work in tandem with more powerful units. They make strategic use of this scenario, keeping their opponents occupied until it is too late to react to the combined Cerberus force bearing down on them.</String>
		<String id="711415">Cerberus: Trooper</String>
		<String id="711416">The SSV Normandy SR-1 was a prototype starship developed by the human Systems Alliance with assistance from the Citadel Council. The ship employed state-of-the-art stealth technology for reconnaissance in dangerous regions.

Most ships emit heat that is easy to detect against the absolute-zero background of space. The Normandy, however, could temporarily store its waste heat deep within the hull, allowing the ship to travel undetected for hours--or drift passively for days of covert observation. This was not without risk. Eventually, the stored heat had to be released, or it would build to levels that could cook the crew alive. 

Another key component of the Normandy's stealth system was the revolutionary Tantalus drive, a mass effect core twice the size of a standard unit. The Tantalus drive generated mass concentrations that the Normandy "fell into," allowing it to move without the use of heat-emitting thrusters. 

The Normandy SR-1 was destroyed in 2183 when it was ambushed by a Collector ship in the Omega Nebula.</String>

		<String id="711418">The Reapers took Earth in a matter of hours. The Alliance knew the first wave would arrive from batarian space, but they were unprepared for the speed and scale of the attack. 

The Reapers bypassed the Sixth and Seventh Fleets at Terra Nova and Eden Prime, flying straight from relay to relay where they could neither be tracked nor intercepted. The tactic was unexpected, since the navies of organic species would never risk coming out of FTL within combat range or leaving enemies at their backs to threaten supply lines. 

At Arcturus Station, more than a dozen Reaper capital ships engaged the Alliance's Second, Third, and Fifth Fleets. This was mere screening for the main force. Dozens more capital ships continued through the Charon Relay, where the First Fleet had been lying in wait but was soon destroyed. The Fourth Fleet, near Earth, had a few minutes of advance warning. It stood no better chance.

After destroying Earth's comm buoys, smaller Reaper destroyers wiped out all GPS and communications satellites in Earth's orbit and cut the undersea fiber-optic cables that linked the continents. Earth's resistance now relies on outdated radio towers and a few quantum entanglement communicators whose matched pairs happen to be on other continents or outside the Sol system. Communication is so limited that the fate of entire nations remains unknown.

The capital ships bombarded defense installations and industrial centers, annihilating entire cities with populations in the low millions, including Adelaide, Hamburg, Al Jubail, and Fort Worth. Meanwhile, Reaper destroyers descended into the atmosphere to melt roads and capture population centers with minimal loss of life. This is not an example of the Reapers being merciful. More likely, they are herding their prey to make the coming harvest that much easier.</String>

		<String id="711420">Sixteen years ago, the Systems Alliance established the first dish field on Ontarom, defying the tidal disruptions and electrical storms that periodically sweep across the planet. The facility has since grown into a crucial communications hub for the Alliance. 

Trade between the Alliance base and nearby human settlements sustains planetary unity. The Alliance also trains and hires colonists to maintain the quantum communicators, further strengthening the bond between locals and the military forces that use the comm stations.

Although most of the communication relays serve the military, a coalition of Ontarom's businesses has begun construction on a civilian broadcast hub. The local Alliance commander has offered the help of the military's technical experts, making Ontarom a symbol of civilian and military cooperation.</String>

		<String id="711422">Sanctum is known for the freezing ice storms which sweep across its poles and temperate zones, with only a thin strip of habitable land along the equator. Because of those harsh living conditions, Sanctum attracts only the most gruff and hardy, from miners to mercenaries to company men. Mining, referred to as "ice cracking" anywhere but the equator, is the backbone of Sanctum's economy. The planet is rich in platinum and palladium deposits, as well as boron, which is locally used in semiconductor doping.

Sanctum's corporate factions have learned that Cerberus is involved in the planet's finances. Systems Alliance intelligence agents embedded within the corporate strata are quietly urging the companies to confront Cerberus directly, but so far, financial bickering has kept Sanctum's major stakeholders from acting against the Illusive Man.</String>

		<String id="711424">Benning was once a thriving human colony, but the Reapers have rounded up a large portion of the populace for processing. Some pockets of civilian resistance still elude the Reapers, however, and rescue attempts are underway. A "resistance radio" established during the early days of the attack continues to broadcast, exhorting survivors to band together and discussing rumors of safe havens. Unfortunately, those rumors have begun to result in ambushes, increasing the desperation of those who remain free.

Through all this, Benning's automated agricultural systems have continued to operate, leading to unprecedented stores of food in the planet's granaries and warehouses.</String>

		<String id="711426">Cyone, a fortified world under the protection of several asari matriarchs, has begun to supply fuel to Systems Alliance forces in the hope that an asari-human partnership might prevent the Reapers from seizing the planet. Alliance forces have since established several outposts in the system.

The humans and asari have been joined by a small detachment of turians, drawn from the private militia of a corporate conglomerate that does business with Cyone. The three species are so determined to defend Cyone that integration issues have been negligible.

The task force has already thrown back several Reaper attacks, although the commanders express concern that small Reaper forces could have slipped through despite their vigilance.</String>
		<String id="711427">Cyone</String>
		<String id="711428">Although clearly technologically superior to the Citadel forces, the Reapers have experienced casualties in the battles across the galaxy. This indicates that, theoretically, with the right intelligence, weapons, and strategy, the Reapers could be defeated. 

Unlike the mass effect relays that they created, Reapers do not have quantum shields. Locking itself down at a quantum level would leave a Reaper unaware of its surroundings until the shielding deactivated. Instead, Reapers rely on kinetic barriers.

In the case of a Reaper capital ship, these kinetic barriers can hold off the firepower of two dreadnoughts simultaneously, but three clearly causes strain, and four typically results in destruction. Weapons designed to maximize heat damage, such as the Thanix series, show better results against the Reapers than pure kinetic impacts.

The barriers of a Reaper destroyer are less formidable than those of a capital ship. It is possible for a single cruiser or many fighters to disable or demolish a destroyer if they can get within range before they are themselves destroyed.

The Reapers' energy sources are not infinite. For example, to land on a planet, a Reaper must substantially reduce its mass. This transfer of power to its mass effect generators leaves the Reaper's kinetic barriers at only partial strength.

Sovereign was destroyed while assuming direct control over Saren. The feedback from Saren's death seemed to entirely overload Sovereign's shields. Current Reapers do not seem to suffer from this design flaw.

Reaper capital ships can turn faster than Citadel dreadnoughts, but to do so, they must lower their mass to a level unacceptable in combat situations. Consequently, it is possible for a dreadnought to emerge from FTL travel behind a capital ship, then bring its guns to bear faster than the Reaper can return fire. This is a poor tactic, however, against Reapers flying in proper formation.</String>

		<String id="711430">The Reapers are technologically superior to the organic species of the galaxy--but the degree of that superiority is a matter of debate in the intelligence community.

The Reapers' thrusters and FTL drives appear to propel them at more than twice the speed of Citadel ships. Estimates of their location in dark space suggest they can travel nearly 30 light-years in a 24-hour period.

Reaper power sources seem to violate known physical laws. Reapers usually destroy fuel infrastructure rather than attempting to capture it intact, indicating that Reapers do not require organic species' energy supplies. Consequently, the Reapers attack without regard for maintaining supply lines behind them, except to move husks from one planet to another. Unlike Citadel ships, Reapers do not appear to discharge static buildup from their drive cores, although they sometimes appear wreathed in static discharge when they land on planets.

The main gun on a Reaper capital ship dwarfs that of the Alliance's Everest-class dreadnoughts. No dreadnought has yet survived a direct hit from the weapon. Estimates put its destructive power anywhere from 132 to 454 kilotons of TNT. Even if the target is hardened, as in the case of a surface-based missile silo, the gun can instead bury the target beneath molten metal. Precise targeting computers and correctors also give Reaper weapons a longer effective range than organics' dreadnoughts or cruisers.

The kinetic barriers on a Reaper capital ship can shrug off the firepower of a small fleet. Weapons specifically designed to overcome shields, such as the Javelin, GARDIAN lasers, or the Thanix series, can bypass the barriers to some degree. The difficulty is getting close enough to use them--the surface-mounted weaponry on Reaper ships, similar in principle to GARDIAN, presents an effective defense against organic species' fighters.</String>

		<String id="711432">The quarians' plan to take back their homeworld met with early success, but ultimately led to the near annihilation of their people.

In an initial battle against the Reaper-upgraded geth ships, the quarians found their Heavy Fleet and a portion of the Patrol Fleet outmatched. To stave off defeat, the quarians retreated at FTL speeds to rally with the Civilian fleet on the far side of Rannoch's sun, Tikkun. Temporarily hidden, but with only minutes of advance warning should a geth scout spot them, the quarians planned counterattacks to disrupt the geth link with the Reapers. First preying on a damaged geth dreadnought, the quarians followed by sending strike teams to Rannoch's surface to destroy the Reaper that was transmitting improved software to geth forces.

The quarians re-engaged the geth fleet, expecting to find their enemy now hobbled. Instead, the geth responded with unparalleled precision, devastating the fighters that the quarians used as scout ships. This forced the quarians to commit other forces earlier than planned. The geth then attacked the quarian rear with a second fleet that they had held in reserve, laying waste to the liveships and Civilian Fleet. The quarians, knowing the liveships would not survive long if they were forced to retreat without protection, threw every ship into the battle. The geth fought mechanically, downing ship after ship as the quarians flailed in desperation. Some few quarian ships did escape--but alone and on the run in geth space, they are living numbered days.</String>

After the quarians eliminated the Reaper, the geth's processing power dropped precipitously and their bandwidth became clogged with queries for new instructions. Quarian fighters reported the exact positions of geth ships so that the liveships could fire safely on the geth from the far side of Tikkun, using the star's gravity as a slingshot. The geth command-and-control network was now in tatters, their forces separated by vast distances. The quarians hunted them like animals. It was not a one-sided victory--despite vast losses, the geth staged a tireless defense--but it was final.</String>

		<String id="711436">For every thousand batarian refugees, there are a thousand and one stories about how the Reapers invaded the batarian systems. A few elements are common to almost every version, however. The Reapers arrived first in the Vular system and immediately destroyed its communications network. The Hegemony's Department of Information Control blamed the loss of signal on space weather, but scrambled ships to the system nonetheless. Within a day, Reaper capital ships appeared in the Harsa system and descended on the batarian homeworld, Khar'shan.

For all the rhetoric about the Hegemony's military prowess, their response to the Reapers was uncoordinated. Moments after the information minister took to the extranet and announced that unknown ships were destroying all space traffic near Khar'shan, the defense minister declared there was no reason to panic. The planet's comm buoys were destroyed next, creating an ominous silence that has persisted ever since.

Fearing they were next, batarian colonies across Hegemony space began evacuations. So many refugees poured into the human-occupied Exodus Cluster that Systems Alliance officials at first thought the batarians were invading. 

More systems have gone dark as their comm buoys were destroyed, and millions more batarians, trapped on their planets, sit waiting for the Reapers.</String>

		<String id="711691">The quarians' plan to take back their homeworld was risky, and could easily have led to their annihilation if a peaceful solution had not been found.

In an initial battle against the Reaper-upgraded geth ships, the quarians found their Heavy Fleet and a portion of the Patrol Fleet outmatched. To stave off defeat, the quarians retreated at FTL speeds to rally with the Civilian fleet on the far side of Rannoch's sun, Tikkun. Temporarily hidden, but with only minutes of advance warning should a geth scout spot them, the quarians planned counterattacks to disrupt the geth link with the Reapers. First preying on a damaged geth dreadnought, the quarians followed by sending strike teams to Rannoch's surface to destroy the Reaper that was transmitting improved software to geth forces.

When the Reaper uplink was disrupted, the geth suffered momentary downgrades in response time and intelligence, allowing the quarians to press their advantage. But an emergency order from Commander Shepard and Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay broke off hostilities before the geth's full capabilities were restored. It is to the quarians' credit that all three fleets obeyed the order to cease fire, even the Civilian Fleet, which had little combat experience. The geth, for their part, bore no ill will towards enemy combatants and broke off hostilities with perfect discipline.

It remains to be seen how the geth and the quarians will manage to coexist on Rannoch. For now, they have committed their considerable military forces to repel the Reapers. Given the long-lasting animosity between the geth and quarians, it is possible that the Reapers did not plan for the possibility of such an alliance and will be unprepared to contend with both armadas.</String>

		<String id="712010">Core Stability</String>
		<String id="712011">The Reapers' first attack on turian space followed an age-old maxim: hit them where it hurts. A populous colony dating back centuries, Taetrus was already embedded in the turian psyche as the site of the worst terrorist attack in turian history. Wounds were still raw from the Vallum Blast, in which a separatist revolutionary slammed a starship into the colony's capital, killing more than a hundred thousand turians. Hierarchy forces responded with a massive invasion of the planet to stamp out the separatist movement. It was a catharsis for the turians, reassuring them that heroes would always triumph over evil. And so the Reapers struck Taetrus first.

By the time Taetrus went dark, the turians had already learned that the batarians and humans were under attack. The Hierarchy responded with what they believed was overwhelming force, only to walk into a trap. Reaper ships were waiting on the other side of the relay to Taetrus, and they released devastating firepower the moment the fleet emerged. Turian leaders observing the one-sided battle were faced with a choice: reinforce their side of the relay to defend against a Reaper invasion, or throw more resources into an offense. With soldiers and civilians alike clamoring for retribution against the Reapers, the turians continued the assault. The Hierarchy sent warp bombs through the relay to clear a path, fighting tooth and talon to inflict casualties against the Reaper fleet. It was a valiant effort, but doomed. The Reapers emerged victorious from the relay and began broadcasting a signal to turian comm buoys--images of Vallum, Taetrus's capital, once again a smoking wreck. The fight for turian space had begun.</String>
		<String id="712012">The Fall of Taetrus</String>
		<String id="712013">When Taetrus fell, the turians knew little about the Reapers except that they wanted to enrage the turians. Staying calm, the turians massed in force around Palaven, their homeworld. Fleet Admiral Irix Coronati, in what became known as the "Fifteen-Minute Plan," stationed only two carriers, Undaunted and Resolute, near the system's relay. When the Reaper fleet emerged, the carriers launched swarms of unmanned fighters and spy drones. These were quickly destroyed, but the drones transmitted vital data on the Reapers' effective range, fleet composition, and exact location. The turians' other ships then deployed to defend the system in earnest.

Knowing that the Reapers' weapons had a longer effective range than any of his own, Coronati made a short, daring FTL jump--landing his dreadnoughts in the middle of the Reaper fleet. The dreadnoughts then turned to line up their main guns on the Reapers, which also needed to turn to fire on the turians. This ploy used the Reapers' size against them--because they could turn faster, the turian dreadnoughts locked targets first, and their concentrated firepower downed several Reaper capital ships.

The Reapers countered instantly. Their destroyers performed a jump of their own to the skies above Palaven, beginning orbital strikes on turian cities. The turians, forced to defend the planet, found themselves in a pitched battle far from the relay, from which emerged a seemingly endless line of Reaper ships. After massive casualties, Coronati ordered retreat.

The turians insist that Palaven is not lost--the battle has merely moved to the ground. Reaper troop transports have dumped hordes of husks to capture Palaven's inhabitants, but met with little success. Reaper capital ships are destroying city after city. But much of the turian fleet is still operable, and the citizenry is heavily armed. The turians refuse to be intimidated.</String>
		<String id="712014">The Battle of Palaven</String>
		<String id="712015">The turian and krogan counterattack on Palaven combined deception, courage, and tenacity. First, the turians leaked a false battle plan that drew on the same tactics they used at beginning of the assault on Palaven. Then the dreadnought Indomitable faked a problem with its drive core, coming out of FTL near Palaven's moon, Menae. Three other dreadnoughts and their attendant fleets deployed to assist Indomitable, a tempting target that drew the Reaper capital ships away from Palaven. Turian troop transports then entered Palaven's atmosphere to release shuttles, gliders, and individual soldier capsules.

The Reapers did not understand the seriousness of the threat at first--those that detected the landing crafts sent husks and Collector swarms to intercept them, but little more. This allowed krogan commandos to link up with Palaven's resistance and hand off their payloads--warp bombs and fission weapons.

In simultaneous strikes across the globe, Reaper ships began to explode. Turian resistance members had managed to smuggle the bombs inside when the Reaper processing ships, troop transports, and even destroyers and capital ships had opened their structures to indoctrinate turian leaders. 

Large swaths of territory fell back into turian and krogan control. News of the victory gave a much-needed boost to the morale of the turian resistance and the galactic public.

But the action was not without sacrifice. Turian insurgents gave their lives to ensure the explosives detonated, and the processing centers they destroyed were full of civilians who died just as surely as if they had been harvested. Of the dead, General Minin Resvirix said, "Whatever they were in life, their deaths had no equal. They are worthy of joining the spirit of Palaven itself."</String>

Promavess's methane-ethane atmosphere is likely to ignite when it mingles with Sotera's oxygen, and both planets will shatter under the force of the collision.

My name is Bertram Carter and I am writing with very sad news. Your son Bilial was killed. I am sending his dogtags to you.
I was with a group of people yesterday who came under fire. Your son was really brave and saved a lot of us. He just ran right out and drew fire from the troopers. Saved his squad too.
You should be proud. Wish I'd known him.
Yours Truly, 
Bertram Carter</String>
		<String id="712074">The assault on Thessia did not go as smoothly as the Reapers' strikes against other races. While other species met the Reapers head-on, the asari resorted to dangerous hit-and-run tactics to harass their attackers. By engaging in guerilla strategies--blasting a Reaper ship, then jumping to FTL where they could not be tracked--the asari forced the Reapers to remain on the defensive.

Unfortunately, the Reapers' greater numbers allowed them to accept certain losses, so they soon ignored the attacks against them and began orbital bombardment of Thessia. This in turn forced the asari to defend their homeworld with a more traditional stance, facing the Reaper forces directly. As soon as the Reapers landed on Thessia, the harvesting began.

A swift and brutal slaughter of the asari ground forces followed. Resistance from trained biotics barely slowed the attackers down. In the end, Thessia's minimal military forces, combined with unpreparedness in the face of an overwhelming enemy, resulted in the fall of the planet.</String>

The Collectors became a terrifying force in the galaxy, responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands.

		<String id="712568">The lack of adequately preserved archives presents a significant obstacle to research into ancient krogan history. Nevertheless, recent archeological discoveries have shed new light on the topic, revealing a society once rich with cultural, architectural, and artistic accomplishments. 

Newly discovered ruins reveal that the krogan had particularly advanced understandings of structural and geotechnical engineering, as compared to other cultures at similar stages of development. Old krogan architecture demonstrates seismic loading techniques that would have both resisted earthquakes and diffused the small-scale vibrations from vehicles in their sprawling cities. Curiously, however, Tuchanka has little natural tectonic activity. Instead, researchers believe the ancient krogan were concerned with safe cohabitation with one of the planet's apex predators--Kalros, the Mother of all Thresher Maws.

Prior to the genophage, krogan population growth was limited by predation, disease, and war. Even so, the birth rate exploded once the krogan achieved industrialization, leading to wars over resources and living space. Other species on Tuchanka suffered greatly as the krogan expanded. When the krogan ran out of land, they settled into an arms race that ended in nuclear devastation. Tuchanka's relatively short Golden Age was at an end.

But this ancient history may yet aid the modern krogan. Some of the techniques and technology discovered in the ruins could be used to improve standard colonization equipment, signaling economic renewal for the krogan at last.</String>

		<String id="712574">The Citadel Council has called for the immediate donation of Prothean artifacts to bolster the war effort, primarily items of Reaper origin and recordings of their attacks.

The ExoGeni Corporation set an example by donating a store of newly discovered paleotechnology and releasing the data archives of deep-space research colonies destroyed by the Reapers. Several private collectors have since stepped forward to donate the entirety of their collections. 

But despite an offer of amnesty for anyone concealing such artifacts, not everyone has responded as the Council hoped. Several artifacts have been found in obscure underground markets on safe-haven worlds, presumably sold by newly arrived refugees who needed funds to survive.

Reports say that smugglers continue to sell stolen artifacts, and armed raids on archeological sites have rendered even legal operations extremely hazardous. After several reports of mercenary groups turning on the archeologists who hired them, Elanus Risk Control Services began to offer security details for archeological sites at considerably reduced rates.</String>

		<String id="712579">Founded during the early decades of human space expansion, the Alliance News Network was originally a low-profile news organization known mostly for a series of exposés on the First Contact War. With a focus on galaxy-wide reporting, the ANN opened bureaus on planets across known space, winning a few awards for excellence and earning a multi-species audience. 

The Alliance News Network has never been funded by the Systems Alliance, despite what its name might imply. This led to regular confusion among those not in the know, although the network's recent high-profile sale to a media conglomerate made the ownership structure clearer. 

The new management has opted for a more sensational approach. This is particularly obvious from changes to its roster of reporters, with a few of the network's luminaries retiring or joining other news organizations. The network's increasingly lurid programming has gained wide attention as well as sorely needed ratings--all the proof that management needed to validate its course. Nonetheless, ANN insists that integrity and credibility are inviolable standards in the newsroom.

Battlespace is among ANN's highest rated programs, known for a particularly titillating breed of reporting. Among the show's most noteworthy segments are Diana Allers's dispatches from the front lines. The network calls her reports "gritty and realistic," but she has been criticized for her unabashed focus on the violence of war. Even critics of Allers agree, however, that despite her often graphic visuals, the facts she reports are just that--facts.</String>

		<String id="712581">Even with all the Reapers' power, harvesting every sapient species in an entire galaxy can take decades or even centuries. The most time-consuming part of the process is gathering DNA from the population. To accelerate the effort, the Reapers follow a consistent procedure.

Victims who cooperate, surrender, or are captured by husks are sorted into camps. It is believed the husks possess receptors that allow them to analyze a victim's DNA through sight, smell, or touch. Victims that meet their standards are herded from the camps into processor ships. Those the husks deem insufficient are either turned into husks themselves or indoctrinated to serve as slave labor. The Reapers use this last option to give their victims false hope--many captives who would otherwise fight back become docile when they see members of their own kind obey and survive.

The processor ships reduce victims to a transportable liquid. Like in a slaughterhouse, the ships' design prevents victims from seeing or hearing what happens elsewhere so that they do not panic. The victims are ushered into locking pods, then rent apart and dissolved into paste that is flushed to storage vats.

The rate of killing is phenomenal. Intelligence estimates suggest there are more than 400 processor ships on Earth, killing approximately 1.86 million humans per day. In combination with battlefield deaths, disease, and famine, this pace will result in the complete depopulation of Earth within a decade. As the husks and indoctrinated slaves build more slaughtering facilities, the kill rate can only increase.</String>

		<String id="712584">Although body armor and kinetic barriers provide significant protection for relatively low cost, technically savvy soldiers sometimes go further.

"Tech armor" is the common term for a complex series of field generators that disrupt incoming force using a stationary warp effect. The theory is that bullets that would normally shatter on impact instead break apart when they strike the field. The field then bleeds away the shrapnel's kinetic energy. The standard design for tech armor traps the warp field between two low-yield kinetic barriers to protect the user from the field itself. When the outer barrier fails, the warp effect is discharged, potentially harming anyone nearby. For this reason, many soldiers modify the armor with a haptic-style light effect to warn allies not to get too close. On missions where stealth is paramount, this effect is disabled. Cynical soldiers joke that the design is called "tech armor" because if it were simply called "warp armor," no one would use it.

The "fortification" approach uses high-energy batteries and superconductive devices within the armor to create a Foucault-current effect, essentially a magnetic field that can immobilize metals, even nonferrous ones. The field is triggered by sensors similar to those in a kinetic barrier. It is powerful enough to protect against most modern weapons, but there are drawbacks. The currents cause metallic objects to hold their position relative to one another, and although the field only lasts for a split second, it creates resistance that can slow or fatigue the wearer. Without specialized training, a soldier can quickly become exhausted or stumble at the wrong time.</String>

		<String id="712586">Faced with utter annihilation, military planners have considered extreme solutions in their quest to stop the Reapers. The two most plausible are the destruction of mass relays and the use of starships as suicide weapons.

Destroying a mass relay to stop the Reapers' advance is infeasible. Although it has recently been proven that mass relays can be destroyed, a ruptured relay liberates enough energy to ruin any terrestrial world in the relay's solar system. It would take too long to evacuate the millions or billions of people living near each relay, and the Council is unwilling to sacrifice that many lives when combat stands a chance of saving them. Even if a garden world were to survive the relay's destruction, the Reapers have infinite patience. They traveled out of dark space using conventional FTL--travel within the galaxy is not an insurmountable barrier.

Meanwhile, starships are too costly to be used as projectiles, given that it would take many collisions to seriously harm a Reaper. Some armchair admirals suggest that a single starship traveling faster than light could obliterate a Reaper capital ship, but all ships based on mass effect technology possess hardwired safety features to prevent FTL collisions. If a ship's FTL plotter finds a significant object in the path of a planned jump, the FTL drive refuses to fire in the first place. This is not a perfect safety feature--the sensors can only scan for objects within a reasonable distance at light speed, and a navigator must plot the rest of the course--but it is so inherent to the FTL warm-up process that removing it is nigh impossible. Cynical intelligence analysts note that the secret of mass effect technology, including that safety system, has always been attributed to the Protheans--just as the mass relays were.</String>

		<String id="713346">With Spectre-level access codes, it is possible to bypass standard security protocols and track top-level diplomatic dispatches. The location of consoles accessed using suspect ciphers will be uploaded to the Spectre's omni-tool and highlighted for easy detection.</String>
		<String id="713347">Spectre-level access codes can bypass privacy settings and track financial data, transit records, and personal communications for all employees in the hanar embassy. To avoid triggering surveillance countermeasures, embassy files must be accessed on site. NavPoints of consoles or access points with relevant information will be tagged on the Spectre's omni-tool.</String>
		<String id="713348">Volus ambassador Din Korlack's current location is unknown. Biometric analysis does not detect him in any public location at this time. His last known position was an office suite near the human embassy.</String>
		<String id="713349">A batarian patient named Ghorek is located in a makeshift clinic in the temporary refugee camp at Docking Bay E24. He is suffering from undisclosed but severe injuries. Medical staff from Huerta Memorial Hospital have provided painkillers, but there is no viable long-term treatment. Because the Batarian Hegemony refuses to share records, no data on Ghorek is available prior to his arrival on the Citadel.</String>
		<String id="713350">Huntress Aeian T'Goni is a patient at Huerta Memorial Hospital. She is currently on stress leave due to a mission on the human colony of Tiptree, where she was forced to kill a human civilian to prevent both of them from being discovered by Reaper forces. T'Goni has repeatedly requested a permit to carry weapons on the Citadel. The request has been denied because of T'Goni's paranoia and the possibility of self-inflicted harm. Spectre authority can override these security measures and grant T'Goni the right to a firearm.</String>
		<String id="713351">C-Sec has requested a number of surveillance warrants in an attempt to find evidence that would incriminate Cerberus informants on the Citadel. Officers have tapped public surveillance feeds but do not have legal access to private security feeds. Spectre authorization would enable C-Sec to tap into business feeds without informing civilian agencies.</String>
		<String id="713352">This financial report is for top-level embassy access only. According to financial estimates from First Irune Investment Trusts, a division of Elkoss Combine, the Citadel races cannot sustain the cost of the war effort for more than one year. Although military spending has stimulated certain market sectors, shortages and rationing in other areas have depressed the financial system. Civilian discretionary spending has fallen except in entertainment areas like escapist vids and drinking. First Irune is borrowing heavily to provide funds for key functions across the Citadel, but if the war does not end within the next year, galactic financial collapse is inevitable.</String>
		<String id="713353">C-Sec has fielded requests for a civilian militia to defend the Citadel in the event of another attack. Many C-Sec officers believe a militia would benefit the Citadel's state of readiness and improve morale, but they lack funds and clearance for the program. Spectre authorization would allow C-Sec to begin training civilian volunteers, using funds normally allocated to executive bonuses.</String>
		<String id="713354">C-Sec has noticed that weapons dealers are breaking regulations by selling weapons to civilians without the proper permits. The dealers have argued that they are giving civilians the ability to protect themselves, and many C-Sec officials privately sympathize. Spectre authorization will give C-Sec officers leeway to turn a blind eye to sales that they deem harmless. This could improve morale around the Citadel in the wake of the Cerberus attack.</String>
		<String id="713355">Reservists called to active duty are not drawing full pay because of the scale of the galactic threat and the massive funding required to match salaries and partner benefits for so many on short notice. Using Spectre authority to mandate salary-matching for all personnel with partners or dependents on the Citadel would require cuts to tax incentives and post-war economic stimulus goals.</String>
		<String id="713356">Medical supplies originally meant for occupied zones have been rerouted to the Citadel because the Reaper invasion has made delivery impossible. The supplies are currently in lockdown on the docks, but can be released to the Huerta Memorial Hospital under Spectre authority.</String>
		<String id="713357">Private Talavi has requested a transfer to a unit actively engaged against Reaper hostiles. A note from Sergeant Olembe says that Private Talavi is an exceptional engineer, recommending her for duty on a team set to sabotage Reaper processing centers. Spectre authorization would fast-track this request.</String>
		<String id="713358">Commander Bailey has requested assistance with a con man who is preying on refugees. The man has exploited loopholes to delay his arrest. Spectre authorization would allow C-Sec to immediately deport the con man from the Citadel.</String>
		<String id="713359">An importer/exporter with past convictions for smuggling has offered to gather critical supplies for Alliance forces and civilian medical emergencies. C-Sec believes the offer is in good faith and has refused to make an arrest, but is legally restricted from accepting her offer without Spectre authorization.</String>
		<String id="713360">An asari aid has requested visas so that family members of asari commandos can relocate to Thessia. Because the family members have been separated by the war, ordinary approvals are not possible. Spectre authorization would allow the family members to relocate from the Citadel to the asari homeworld.</String>
		<String id="713361">Captain Riley, an N7 operative killed in the line of duty, has been nominated for a posthumous commendation. The award is to be presented to her family in lieu of her body, which could not be retrieved. Approval from a Spectre would fast-track the award process.</String>
		<String id="713362">Captain Riley, an N7 operative, has been nominated for a commendation for valor for her actions at Cyone. Approval from a Spectre would fast-track the award process.</String>
		<String id="713363">Instructors at Grissom Academy have requested facilities on the Citadel to train young students who escaped the attack on the school but who are not yet ready to join the older students in combat. Citadel authorities will find room for the students if a Spectre approves the request.</String>
		<String id="713364">Unless Purgatory's power grid is improved, the nightclub may need to cut back on entertainment. Given morale on the Citadel, keeping Purgatory operational may prove beneficial in the long term. Schematics for an older krogan power system can be purchased for a nominal fee.</String>
		<String id="713365">Patients in Huerta Memorial Hospital are dying from new and unfamiliar types of chemical burns. This is a problem for military personnel fighting both Cerberus and Reaper adversaries. For a small fee, the salarian Special Tasks Group is willing to share data on burn treatments from a research facility on Sur'Kesh. To maintain deniability, any information obtained in this manner should be attributed to other sources.</String>
		<String id="713366">Asari commandos are reporting increased burnout of biotic amps relative to biotic human soldiers. This is negatively impacting the performance of asari and mixed-species units in prolonged combat. An instructor at Grissom Academy who was fired for theft is offering to sell schematics for new biotic amps that could be adapted for asari use. To maintain deniability, any technology obtained in this manner should be attributed to Grissom Academy.</String>
		<String id="713367">The salarian colony of Senoquol is experiencing a power shortage that threatens their egg incubators. The colony will be forced to evacuate unless improved heating stabilizers can be found. The loss of a colony could amplify the difficulty of gaining salarian support for the war effort. Hanar heating stabilizer technology can be purchased for a nominal fee.</String>
		<String id="713368">When Cerberus forces fled the Citadel after their failed coup, they left behind automated turrets and proximity charges. These were likely intended to further undermine morale on the Citadel. Improving C-Sec's ability to disable Cerberus antipersonnel devices would reduce civilian casualties and allow C-Sec to focus on finding Cerberus sympathizers. If granted the necessary funding, Alliance operatives familiar with Cerberus tech can obtain control schematics for the turrets.</String>
		<String id="713369">A turian general was injured while defending civilians during the Cerberus attack on the Citadel. He is now at Huerta Memorial Hospital, but his injury has been complicated by use of a toxin developed specifically for turian physiology. A former Alliance researcher is willing to sell data on a similar toxin, which was developed in case of a war with Palaven. To avoid diplomatic embarrassment, any information obtained in this manner should be treated as if discovered at a Cerberus facility.</String>
		<String id="713370">Increased injuries among non-human patients at Huerta Memorial Hospital has led to a need for an improved medi-gel formula. This would reduce fatalities and free up medical resources across the Citadel.</String>
		<String id="713371">Alliance code-breakers are having difficulty cracking Cerberus encryption. For a nominal fee, the salarian Special Tasks Group is willing to sell encryption algorithms recovered from Cerberus engineers during the attack on Sur'Kesh. Because the sale violates protocol and risks political repercussions within the salarian government, the seller has asked that STG's involvement be kept quiet. Instead, the data should be marked as discovered on the body of a Cerberus engineer whose equipment failed to self-destruct.</String>
		<String id="713372">Asari war strategists have encountered difficulty predicting Reaper movements due to poor understanding of Reaper thought processes. A scavenger is willing to sell a Reaper processor that he discovered among the debris from Sovereign's attack on the Citadel several years ago. This intel could dramatically improve the efforts of asari forces.</String>
		<String id="713373">An Eclipse covert ops team is willing to sell jamming technology they recovered from a geth station. Deploying these jamming units on the Presidium could hinder enemy forces in the case of another attack on the Citadel, thereby saving civilian lives. Because the Alliance cannot formally support Eclipse mercenary work, this technology should be treated as though it were discovered during action on Rannoch.</String>
		<String id="713374">Alliance soldier Bilal Osoba, the son of Ambassador Dominic Osoba, is missing in action on Benning and presumed dead. Civilians engaged in black-market trades with occupying Cerberus troops have been able to procure the dog tags of fallen Alliance soldiers, and obtaining proof of Bilal's death would ease his father's mind. To maintain deniability of black-market trafficking, the dog tags should be presented as though the Spectre personally retrieved them from Bilal Osoba's body.</String>

		<String id="714096">Councilor Udina's attempted coup will no doubt be analyzed for generations to come, but a clear picture is beginning to emerge. Udina had contacted Cerberus to coordinate what was intended to be a bloodless takeover of the Citadel, in which he would force the other councilors to grant him emergency powers so that he could command the Citadel Fleet. He would then direct the fleet to liberate his homeworld, Earth.

The plan fell apart early when Executor Pallin and the salarian councilor caught wind of it. In defense of the plan, the Illusive Man dispatched his top assassins, commanded by Kai Leng, to kill them. Udina had little choice but to support the assassins with an armed force sufficient to hold the Citadel. Captured confidantes have indicated that Udina and Leng's alliance was relatively fragile: Udina may have planned to turn on Cerberus once the fleet was his to command, and Leng departed when he calculated that Udina would not succeed.

Persistent rumors suggest that Udina might have been a high-functioning victim of Reaper indoctrination. His actions played right into the Reapers' plans: even if the coup failed, it would damage Citadel governance. If it succeeded, his plan to retake Earth would likely have turned into a military blunder that Council forces could ill afford. However, there is no direct evidence of his indoctrination, nor obvious opportunity. It is more likely that Udina acted out of desperation, and in doing so, cost humanity its councilor.</String>

		<String id="715516">The old saying "every marine is a rifleman" still holds true in the Alliance. Every marine enlistee, from clerk to sniper, goes through a period of infantry training. As a result, the 103rd Marine Division is Earth's largest collection of Special Forces soldiers. Officers from notable battles, such as the Skyllian Blitz and the First Contact War, run harsh training exercises in a variety of environments, insisting the marines be prepared to storm any beach, on any planet. This training has been useful in the Reaper War, as the 103rd can be fighting in an arctic desert one week, crawling through jungles the next.</String>
		<String id="715517">When the Reaper called Sovereign attacked the Citadel in 2183, Rear Admiral Boris Mikhailovich led the 63rd Scout Flotilla against it. The 63rd suffered the fewest losses of any Alliance flotilla during the Battle of the Citadel, while providing crucial support for the Fifth Fleet's carriers and dreadnoughts. The Alliance promoted Mikhailovich from Rear Admiral to Admiral after the battle, and tasked him with rebuilding and upgrading his ships. His combat experience with the Reapers has been invaluable in devising strategies against them.</String>
		<String id="715518">The First Fleet was stationed near the Charon relay when the Reapers invaded the Sol system. By the time Admiral Hackett issued the order to retreat, its size--once the largest in the Alliance navy--had been cut by half. Commanding Admiral Ines Lindholm made the painful decision to use a tenth of the fleet's remaining vessels as cover so the remainder could escape. Her gamble paid off, as the First Fleet limped out of the relay to rally with the rest of the Alliance forces on the run.</String>
		<String id="715519">Stationed at Arcturus, the Third Fleet is headed by Admiral Nitesh Singh. When the Reapers came for the station, Singh had already pulled his command ship, the SSV Logan, back to an ideal firing position for its mass accelerator cannons. The dreadnought's guns managed to slow down a destroyer before it could demolish the Third Fleet, but Singh was forced to retreat in the face of overwhelming opposition from the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="715520">The Fifth Fleet became famous across the galaxy after spearheading Alliance forces at the Battle of the Citadel. It was guarding Arcturus Station when the Reapers attacked. After a bloody and desperate battle, Admiral Hackett gave the order to retreat, sacrificing the entirety of the Alliance Second Fleet to give the Third and Fifth the chance to escape. The Fifth Fleet's engineers are busy repairing its damaged vessels, grimly anticipating a return to Earth and revenge against the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="715521">The Terminus Fleet is an assortment of mercenary vessels and pirate ships bound together by little more than common geography and a fear of the Reapers.

		<String id="715525">The turian 79th Flotilla distinguished itself during the Krogan Rebellions when they clashed with krogan warships above Digeris. The 79th sacrificed themselves in great numbers to bring down krogan vessels attacking the colony. Centuries later, the flotilla continues to rely on speed and stealth to harass the enemy. They run interference, divert fire, and make bombing runs on enemy ground units until antiair defenses manage to target them.</String>
		<String id="715526">The turian navy has the most dreadnoughts of any known species in the Milky Way. The Turian Hierarchy limited production of these ships only because the Treaty of Farixen strictly controls the number of dreadnoughts, due to their destructive capabilities. The turian Sixth Fleet is technically classified as a peacekeeping fleet. Before the Reapers, it was chiefly used to patrol the space around the Citadel. Now it's ready to fly to areas trying to fight off the invasion.</String>
		<String id="715527">Nicknamed the Bridge Burners, Team Zeta are combat engineers who specialize in destroying enemy fortifications in hostile territory.

Lauded by his superiors for his decisive leadership under fire, Kirrahe was promoted and decorated with the prestigious Star of Sur'Kesh. The major continues to join missions with his men, believing that nothing substitutes for experience, and that the best tactical strategies are planned on the battlefield.</String>
		<String id="715532">The Special Tasks Group, or STG, is the salarian military's intelligence service. Its agents operate in small cells specializing in espionage, infiltration, sabotage, and assassination. They favor clandestine strikes that impact conflicts before they begin. Application to the STG is a rigorous process, but once candidates are accepted, they're expected to work in the field immediately. The STG places emphasis on quick thinking and resourcefulness, as its operatives work in enemy territory with little support.</String>

The Reapers' numbers make the latter difficult, but the VSF have joined with civilian resistance forces in occupied areas to help fortify positions, evacuate whoever they can, and engage the Reapers in contested areas.</String>
		<String id="715534">First Lieutenant Kahlee Sanders joined Grissom Academy's board of directors after she gave up her military career. When the Cerberus raid on the academy was thwarted by Commander Shepard, Sanders joined with Alliance engineers working to recreate the Prothean device found on Mars. Her past work as a systems technician, specifically studying synthetic intelligence, has helped decode some of the complex feedback systems that control the weapon's energy output.</String>
		<String id="715535">By pooling their powers together, these gifted students from Grissom Academy can launch biotic artillery strikes that impact targets with the force of a bomb. The process is taxing, but devastates an enemy's front lines. While they've only had a few months of training, Grissom's students are eager to prove themselves in the war.</String>
		<String id="715536">Jack, formerly known as Subject Zero, may be the most talented biotic of her time. After helping Shepard destroy the Collectors, she was offered a teaching position at Grissom Academy by the Alliance. Accepting the position for reasons of her own, Jack continued to hone her skills while training her students. Grissom Board of Directors member Kahlee Sanders has vouched for Jack's energetic, if unorthodox, teaching style, impressed with the inroads made with the children under the rogue biotic's care.</String>
		<String id="715537">Data liberated from a Cerberus research lab includes reports on the composition and strengths of various Reaper units. Alliance scientists are fact-checking the information, but it appears to be genuine, so Alliance military VIs can use it to strategize against the Reapers' ground forces.</String>
		<String id="715538">A squadron of advanced fighter ships was liberated from Cerberus forces in Noveria. Fast, agile, and remarkably fuel efficient, these one-person spacecrafts pack surprisingly heavy firepower for their size. After the Alliance installed their own VI programs and swept for hidden bugs or transmission signals, they repainted the fighters and pressed them into service.</String>
		<String id="715539">The Salarian navy accepts nothing less than bleeding-edge technology in every single vessel. Military observers were puzzled and not a little suspicious when the salarians slowed down dreadnought production, building fewer ships than legally permitted under the Treaty of Farixen. The answer lies in the complexity of their construction. Acting on orders from Sur'Kesh, STG agents procured schematics of the SSV Normandy's stealth systems and the algorithms behind the Normandy SR-2's Reaper IFF signal. Months of research yielded something previously unthinkable--dreadnoughts with stealth capabilities. The salarians expect the Reapers to break through the dreadnoughts' electronic countermeasures eventually, but until then, they have a crucial advantage against their monstrous enemies.</String>
		<String id="715540">The turian 43rd Marine Division was founded during the ancient Unification Wars that rocked Palaven over two thousand years ago. The 43rd maintains relations with other Council races, running joint training exercises with asari, salarian, and more recently, Alliance military forces. Knowing how their allies fight has become an asset, as the 43rd‘s troops have the discipline and experience to integrate into any army, on any battlefield.</String>
		<String id="715541">The turian Seventh Fleet was assigned the privilege and burden of guarding the Crucible during the weapon's construction and deployment. The fleet flies constant surveillance around the massive device, coordinating with Alliance security patrols and VI-run counter-intelligence programs. The Seventh Fleet knows what it would cost the galaxy if the Reapers breached their defenses: every vessel's captain is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice if it ensures the Crucible's safety.</String>
		<String id="715542">A team of exceptionally skilled Special Ops soldiers, Blackwatch is sent on missions that threaten the safety of Palaven itself. It was pulled from the homeworld by order of Primarch Adrien Victus, who wanted to mobilize this elite force in less hopeless situations across the galaxy. The majority of Blackwatch's operations are classified, although it's generally accepted that they have the highest success rate of any turian unit in history. There are rumors that Saren Arterius was part of Blackwatch before becoming a Spectre, although--given his youth when he joined the turian army--it seems highly unlikely.</String>
		<String id="715543">In a society where the military is synonymous with the government, the Turian Engineering Corps is responsible for everything from maintaining sidewalks to creating spaceports. Their fame spread beyond Palaven after they helped repair the damage done to the Citadel by Sovereign in record time. TEC engineers view the Crucible as the greatest challenge of their career, and have sped up the building process with their expertise and equipment.</String>
		<String id="715544">Wreav, the leader of Clan Urdnot, has used the release of a genophage cure to seize control of Tuchanka's armies. The krogan has allied with Commander Shepard to oppose the Reapers, but Wreav's plans extend far beyond the current war. With centuries of life ahead, Wreav has bluntly stated his desire to see a new krogan empire expand after the Reapers are destroyed.</String>
		<String id="715545">Urdnot Wrex fought alongside Commander Shepard during the Reapers' first invasion attempt in 2183. Afterwards, he returned to Tuchanka and spent the following years rising to the leadership of his clan, championing progressive methods meant to strengthen the krogan as a whole. Conservative elements were unhappy, but news of a successfully cured genophage has solidly united all of Tuchanka under Wrex's command. Hailed not only as a great warrior but a savior, the krogan will follow Urdnot Wrex into the maws of the Reapers themselves.</String>
		<String id="715546">"The perfect krogan" was thrown into the world without a past, a name, or a cause. After destroying the Collectors with Commander Shepard, Grunt returned to Tuchanka to learn what it meant to be krogan. After countless arguments and brawls, the clans have granted Grunt a modicum of acceptance. Tough, wary, and cunning, the young krogan knows this experience will pay off now that it's time to fight the Reapers' forces.</String>
		<String id="715547">Ancient Tuchankan legends claim that the Aralakh Wastes, named after the system's star, are where the first warrior died in battle. Aralakh Company is made up of krogan from all over Tuchanka, each chosen for their strength, ferocity, and fighting experience. No krogan community would dream of sending anything less than its finest warriors to represent their clan. The honor of who's to be chosen for the company has started more than one brawl.</String>
		<String id="715548">Not at all mindless insects, the rachni are capable of feats of engineering comparable with any sentient species. While initially greeted with suspicion, the rachni workers dispatched to the Crucible have integrated into the project smoothly. They work especially well on tasks that benefit from group work, and senior Crucible staff members are learning to trust the rachni with more complex problems.</String>
		<String id="715549">Developed by the Alliance, Javelin missiles release dark energy upon impact. This creates devastating space-time disruptions, magnified warp fields that strip away a target's molecular bonds. Even the strongest kinetic barriers will eventually collapse after multiple impacts from these rockets. Alliance R&amp;D commandeered several colony factories, and now produces enough Javelin missile launchers for all dreadnoughts in the allied fleet.</String>
		<String id="715550">The salarian Special Tasks Force appears to have approached the Vol Protectorate about codeveloping combat implants that require rare elements found in volus space. The schematics for these implants include plans to retrofit them to non-salarian species, should it be a sufficiently profitable venture. One of these upgrades could be commissioned, although its construction would be time-consuming and must be custom-made.</String>
		<String id="715551">Volus companies are skilled at mass-producing whatever manufactured goods are currently in demand. Factories use modular equipment to switch their production lines from arms, to housing, to the next big galactic-buying trend. Recovered from a manufacturing compound, these fabrication units can stamp out custom plastics for the Crucible on an industrial scale.</String>
		<String id="715552">The volus have only produced one dreadnought, the Kwunu, named after the diplomat who negotiated their client-race status with the turians. The Kwunu is the only volus ship of its class, but it is remarkably well-armed. Its broadside cannons and main gun are all Thanix Magnetic-Hydrodynamic Weapons. A turian general touring the Kwunu after its maiden system-voyage enthusiastically declared that the ship could "char a planet three times over." While its construction was funded entirely by the Elkoss Combine corporation, the dreadnought was jointly gifted to the Vol Protectorate and Turian Hierarchy upon completion.</String>
		<String id="715553">Elkoss Combine is a manufacturer known for producing reliable, but less expensive, versions of higher-grade weapons and armor. Their scientists are adept at reverse-engineering new technology. The volus engineers rescued from Satu Arrd are applying these same methods to break down instructions on how to create several dozen new plastics that must be integrated into the Crucible's superstructure. In a show of unprecedented generosity, Elkoss Combine has waived all proprietary claims to any new compounds created by its scientists.</String>
		<String id="715554">The Arcturus First Division is a volunteer army of civilians, paramilitary forces, and reserve soldiers, who have banded together to stop the Reaper occupation of the planet Benning. To avoid detection by Reaper forces, its members operate in cells, never staying in one place long. A handful of Alliance officers are coordinating the First Division, sharing intel and sending supplies to the resistance soldiers. A few Alliance squadrons have been spared to support Benning's makeshift army with trained soldiers.</String>
		<String id="715555">Telemetry captured from Arcturus Station shows just how quickly Reapers poured in from the relay and tore through Alliance fleets. VIs can analyze hostile fire in the data collected to increase weapon damage. They can also spend processing power looking for ways to improve shielding against Reaper weapons.</String>
		<String id="715556">Normally interferometric arrays are used to analyze planetary landmasses, or to determine the astrophysical properties of stellar systems. The powerful array salvaged from the Hercules system can be used for something much more ambitious: the Crucible tunes into the mass relays' command switches. Installing the interferometric array into the Crucible's systems results in a real-time map of the entire galaxy, including the position of each and every Reaper in the Milky Way.</String>
		<String id="715557">The ExoGeni Corporation helped fund colonies all over the galaxy, in exchange for a share of any natural resources found by settlers. Zhu's Hope was one of their richest claims--the colonists were obligated to turn over any Prothean discoveries in the ancient ruins on Feros. A team of ExoGeni scientists studying the few scraps of Prothean materials found around Zhu's Hope have become experts in their own right, contributing their knowledge to the Crucible project.</String>
		<String id="715558">Half of team Delta's officers have an N5 designation, with a few N6 soldiers in the ranks. They specialize in conflicts outside Citadel space. Delta is known for strict admission standards, professionalism on high-stakes missions, and the Alliance's loudest parties. When asked how senior staff looks at their off-duty rowdiness, Captain Matthew Brown was quoted saying "After the shit we went through in the Terminus Systems, they're just happy we're not burning down the base."</String>
		<String id="715559">The Shanghai's most important part in the Reaper war to date was the evacuation of the colony Uqbar. Alliance intel reported Reaper forces headed toward Uqbar, but as a cruiser, the Shanghai was unable to land on the medium-gravity world. The Shanghai's captain quickly dispatched all its shuttles to help transport hundreds of colonists onto the ship. Making over 41 shuttle runs in a single hour, the Shanghai managed to evacuate the entire remaining population. When Reaper forces arrived, Uqbar's capital city was as empty as if it had never been inhabited at all.</String>
		<String id="715560">To avoid the risk of indoctrination, remote drones have been sent to study the salvaged remains of a Reaper destroyer. The drones can dig under the outer hull, scanning circuits for technology that will increase the speed at which tech, biotic, and combat abilities can be fired. Alternatively, the Council has offered a Citadel-wide merchant discount for choosing the safer option and demolishing the remains.</String>
		<String id="715561">In peace time, the Alliance's Naval Exploration Flotilla is used as a survey force to chart out new systems. The NEF came under fire in 2185, when several dozen service people were charged with withholding information on rich mining deposits in order to sell the locations to the exploration firm, Baria Frontiers. The Alliance attempted to hide the controversy to little avail, as more and more officers were indicted. Eager to bury its shady history, the NEF has dedicated its entire flotilla and material resources to constructing the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="715562">These Prothean discs were found years ago on Eden Prime, recovered a few months before the discovery of the Prothean Beacon in 2183. For years the data on the discs was incomprehensible, until the Crucible's blueprints provided the key to understanding the equations. Locked inside the discs were theories on dark matter meant to be used with the Crucible's main power source.</String>
		<String id="715563">The Shadow Broker's unnamed vessel served as both a data repository and stealth ship for the enigmatic information trader. The ship ingeniously drew its power from the thunderstorms raging constantly on the planet it orbited, relying on an interlocking system of kinetic barriers, grounding rods and capacitors to avoid being ripped apart. These systems have been repurposed for sections of the Crucible that require the safe discharge of tremendous amounts of energy.</String>
		<String id="715564">The Terminus Systems teem with planets rich in rare elements, minerals, and other raw materials important for the Crucible. Fortunately, the Terminus Systems also have a great quantity of freighter vessels. Athabasca-class ships, while only lightly armored, can carry millions of tons of freight, with fuel tanks optimized for long, hazardous journeys.</String>
		<String id="715565">The Shadow Broker's strength lies in her connections. Dr. Liara T'Soni has a team of operatives able to procure almost any supplies at any time, by using an extensive network of bribes, blackmail and favors. This logistical support has become important to building the Crucible, as the disruption of communications and travel makes gathering resources risky at the best of times.</String>
		<String id="715566">Many respected asari scientists have used their long life spans to become leading experts in their fields. Asari scholars often gain perspective on how cultural shifts affect society, grasping the larger contextual forces behind new proposals and using this to springboard into hypotheses years ahead of their time. The asari science team working on the Crucible consists of some of the keenest scientific mavericks in the galaxy, eager to contribute to its construction.</String>
		<String id="715567">The asari Second Fleet is largely composed of frigates and fighters, embodying the asari's hit-and-run mindset with a nimble swarm rather than a slower collection of vessels. The Second is normally dispatched to protect colonies from pirate raiders or mercenary activity. The Second Fleet's fighter squadrons are intensely competitive, racing to break new records set by other teams, but unquestionably loyal to each other in a fight.</String>
		<String id="715568">The Sixth Fleet has more dreadnoughts than any other collection of ships in the Asari Navy. An almost superstitious dread has grown around its entrance into conflict, as any war with the fleet has never remained small. It was the Sixth Fleet that flew against the rachni in the beginning of the Rachni Wars, and it was the Sixth Fleet that liberated the first colony under siege in the Krogan Rebellions. Unfairly or not, its service people have a reputation for being sober, serious, and humorless. Nevertheless, the Sixth Fleet is a welcome sight for any ally when it arrives.</String>
		<String id="715569">The Destiny Ascension is the flagship of the Citadel Fleet, a powerful asari dreadnought unlike any other vessel in the galaxy. Captained by Matriarch Lidanya, the Destiny Ascension evacuated the Council during the 2183 Battle of the Citadel but was crippled by attacking geth. Alliance fleets came in, taking heavy fire but saving the Ascension and the Council from destruction. The asari have repaired and upgraded the dreadnought's shielding and firepower, committing the formidable ship to the fight against the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="715570">Admiral Daro'Xen is head of quarian Special Projects--research vessels that create and improve the technology that keeps the quarian flotilla operational. Studying the geth all her life, Xen is an expert on synthetic intelligences.</String>
		<String id="715571">The krogan First Division is a conglomeration of infantry and vehicles hastily organized into a single coalition force. The chain of command is divided by clan, with representatives from each serving as officers. Despite ancient differences, fighting the Reapers together is building a spirit of camaraderie among the division's warriors. Krogan from different clans are starting to swap equipment, stories and even the occasional barrel of ryncol.</String>
		<String id="715572">The Illusive Man's search for humanity's best attracted many renowned scientists. Cerberus offered generous salaries, brand new facilities, and unfettered research budgets. Despite these lavish perks, some began to worry about the ethical ramifications of their work. The scientists rescued from Gellix were among the first to leave Cerberus. They diligently help to construct the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="715573">Dr. Brynn Cole is an ex-Cerberus scientist who studied the technology left behind by the Collectors. She eventually cut ties with the Illusive Man, and helped dozens of scientists and their families flee the organization. The doctor has joined the Crucible Project, using the knowledge gained during her employment with Cerberus to help build the weapon.</String>
		<String id="715574">Gavin Archer was a well-known synthetic intelligence specialist from Terra Nova who disappeared years ago to work with Cerberus. Now that he's parted ways with his former employer, Archer is among the scientists working on the Crucible. His study of VIs and AIs--in particular, the geth--gives him unique insights into parallel processing and inter-system communication that have already improved the weapon's efficiency.</String>
		<String id="715575">After helping Commander Shepard destroy the Collectors, Jacob Taylor cut his ties with Cerberus. He joined the war following an attack on a safehouse for former Cerberus operatives, where he was hiding out. Jacob turned down formal reinstatement into the Alliance marine corps, feeling his past with Cerberus disqualified him from their company. Taylor is instead a consultant, advising the Alliance on Cerberus tactics and defenses. He also participates in missions that target the Illusive Man's holdings.</String>
		<String id="715576">Asari Commandos train from an early age to control their minds and bodies, seeking the ultimate economy of thought and movement. They are taught that each shot and each decision be made without hesitation. While exact training methods vary among teams, all commandos are consummate professionals. Their ambushes, quick strikes, and clever tactics have bested larger, well-armed units in thousands of recorded conflicts.</String>
		<String id="715577">The justicars are an ancient asari order dedicated to finding and punishing those who would harm others. They rigidly adhere to the Justicar Code, a comprehensive, complicated list of laws. By assaulting the innocent, slaughtering the helpless, and refusing to acknowledge any authority above themselves, the Reapers are an affront to nearly everything the Code stands for. The Justicar Samara has set aside all other responsibilities, pledging to stop the Reapers, even if it kills her.</String>
		<String id="715578">The barrel of this Reaper weapon can be dismantled for further study. If the miniaturized energy cells powering the gun's systems are taken apart, it could lead to improvements in the damage a weapon can deal. However, an examination of its heat venting systems could instead provide the means to maximize thermal clip storage.</String>
		<String id="715579">Element zero refineries are large industrial facilities that remove impurities from the element, also called eezo, before it is used to fuel starships or gravity generators. It's an important process, as sending an electrical charge through impure eezo can cause the element to explode. By setting up a conversion facility beside the Crucible, eezo can be mined, refined and supplied to the project in record time.</String>
		<String id="715580">The fuel pods scavenged from a field of debris in the Valhallan Threshold were once attached to a fleet of merchant vessels making long, risky journeys into uncharted space. The pods have been repurposed for the Crucible project. When activated, the Crucible's fusion reactors consume entire oceans of helium-3. The fuel pods serve as emergency reservoirs, should the weapon use more power than expected.</String>
		<String id="715581">The Advanced Power Relays are fifteen kilometers of insulated wiring, connected to switch boxes that regulate the energy flow. Installing the relays in the Crucible will prevent catastrophic power surges from overloading its systems.</String>
		<String id="715582">The Haptic Optics Array is an experimental computer user interface. Cortical implants allow users to "see" screens projected in front of them. A user's eye movements are tracked, syncing to hand gestures as they sift through data. While disorienting at first, people using the Optics Array report increased efficiency, and the technology has been adapted by several dozen engineers for use on the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="715583">Guard Captain Vidinos heads a special operatives team that distinguished itself in the War on Taetrus, tracking down turian separatist leaders opposing the Hierarchy. During the war, the separatists rammed a ship traveling at FTL-speeds into the heart of Taetrus's capital. Vidinos's unit experienced their worst fighting in the Diluvian Wildlands, unwelcoming marshes with a population deeply sympathetic to the separatist cause.</String>
		<String id="715584">When Admiral Zaal'Koris sacrificed his vessel to save a liveship, the Civilian Fleet thought they'd lost their leader. After Commander Shepard brought Zaal'Koris back, he passionately argued that the safest action for the Civilian Fleet was to stay with the flotilla. His captains rallied and stayed. The story of Zaal'Koris's miraculous survival on geth-infested Rannoch has spread throughout the flotilla, making him a reluctant hero as he mourns the loss of his ship and crew.</String>
		<String id="715585">Until recently, the geth expected nothing but violence from organics, and designed themselves accordingly. All geth platforms are armed, shielded, and built to withstand combat. When they're on the battlefield, enemy tactics and positions are swapped instantaneously between the AIs. The geth also employ turrets and drones--"expendable" hardware support to keep losses of networked platforms to a minimum. The result is the largest, and perhaps best equipped, infantry in the galaxy.</String>
		<String id="715586">Many geth vessels are built to explore, mine, or provide transport between factories and space stations. But every geth ship, regardless of purpose, is also capable of engaging hostile forces. Unbound by the Treaty of Farixen, the synthetic intelligences built almost as many dreadnoughts as the Turians. The software running these ships is in the geth themselves. Highly advanced electronic security measures and cyber warfare suites bolster already formidable firepower.</String>
		<String id="715587">Geth primes are built to house more programs than other platforms and operate as mobile networking hubs. Their combat software provides a boost to any geth nearby, coordinating and directing attacks. Since the destruction of a prime unit causes the processing power of other geth to drop, prime hardware platforms are heavily shielded and well-armed.</String>
		<String id="715588">The Civilian Fleet makes up most of the quarian flotilla. Properly coordinated, the fleet compensates for its lack of dedicated warships with its sheer numbers. Even its smallest crafts are equipped with ship-to-ship weaponry. The civilian liveships, enormous floating gardens that produce food for the quarians, have also been fitted with massive Thanix cannons to provide heavy firepower.</String>
		<String id="715589">Any pirates or mercenaries attempting to prey on the quarian flotilla must contend with the Heavy Fleet's cruisers, frigates, fighters, and carriers. The Heavy Fleet is led by Admiral Han'Gerrel. The admiral firmly believes in the importance of ship maintenance and regular training exercises, and actively encourages those on pilgrimage to seek out technology that will upgrade his fleet's capabilities. As a result, cutting-edge technology is often found in the best of the Heavy Fleet's vessels.</String>
		<String id="715590">The Patrol Fleet are scouts, flying ahead of the flotilla on the lookout for mineable bodies and hostile forces. They scan space with VI-systems that pick up heat signatures or other signs of foreign vessels. As the first ships to be targeted in any conflict, some of the quarians' finest engineers monitor and repair the Patrol Fleet's shielding. The fleet's commanding officer, Admiral Shala'Raan, relies on speed and shields during combat.</String>
		<String id="715591">The elcor flotilla possesses a few cruisers and carriers, but its real value is troop transport. Because of their shape, the elcor carry shoulder-mounted heavy weapons. VI-run systems handle reloading, targeting, and ammunition selection. It is not unusual to see a troop of elcor soldiers toting rocket launchers, chainguns, and other intimidating weapons on their backs as if they weigh nothing at all.</String>
		<String id="715592">Before fleeing Ontarom with Commander Shepard's help, technician Grace Sato saved a copy of the schematics for the Alliance's most advanced communications relay. Sato will use these schematics to build several smaller arrays to collect crucial intel from points in various systems.</String>
		<String id="715593">Dr. Jelize, the asari scientist found on the research station in the Silean Nebula, was working on a paper that argued nanocircuitry could solve complex behavioral problems in commercial VIs. The doctor's theoretical work seems to be supported by data in the Crucible's blueprints. She now heads the department building the weapon's circuit boards.</String>
		<String id="715594">The Armali Sniper Unit is an elite team of asari commandos who favor long-distance engagement. Some of the unit's soldiers have augmented themselves with strength-boosting cybernetic implants, allowing them to fire heavier guns, like the 39-kilogram M-98 Widow antimateriel rifle, with incredible precision.</String>
		<String id="715595">The Serrice Guard set out to stop Blood Pack mercenaries attempting to enslave asari colonies in the Terminus Systems. After a ship-to-ship fight, the commandos and mercs crash-landed. With no means to contact Thessia, the surviving asari continued to engage the grounded Blood Pack, whittling down the frustrated slavers with traps, ambushes, and nighttime offensives. After nine days and more than 100 casualties, the Blood Pack surrendered. And the mercenaries were astonished to learn they had only been battling five asari commandos. Although the Guard downplayed their heroics, they became instant celebrities upon their return to Thessia.</String>
		<String id="715596">The asari cruiser Nefrane is named for a lost city said to be buried in ice at Thessia's south pole. The cruiser still carries scars from scores of geth fighters it took on during the Battle of the Citadel in 2183. The crew refuses to have the scars removed, considering them marks of honor, and a reminder of how close they came to annihilation.</String>
		<String id="715597">The asari scientists in Orisoni had isolated themselves to prevent academic and corporate theft of their work. They've been researching new polymers, looking for a material with high heat resistance and zero conductivity that is dirt cheap to produce. One of their prototype materials appears ideal for insulating the Crucible's venting chambers.</String>
		<String id="715598">The Cybaen is an asari cruiser-class warship. A mix-up during the cruiser's construction left it with an unusually large drive core and engineers redesigned the ship around the excessive power source. The Cybaen's unusually robust engines provide enough energy to generate kinetic barriers normally reserved for dreadnoughts.</String>
		<String id="715599">The graceful, soaring spires common to asari architecture look deceptively delicate. But Thessia's palaces, universities, and theaters have stood longer than most civilizations. Asari architectural engineers dispatched to the Crucible are testing the weapon's construction to make sure it can withstand tremendous amounts of pressure. If built improperly, stress could tear the Crucible in half upon activation.</String>
		<String id="715600">Data on experimental gene therapies was buried in the ruins of the Pragia Research Facility. While most gene therapy takes years to show results, Pragia's scientists discovered a way to shorten the process. Two intact sample vials have been recovered from the facility. The only limiting factor is that no more than one such therapy can be applied per ten month period without causing serious nerve damage to the recipient.</String>
		<String id="715601">The Alliance Marine Reconnaissance Unit flies recon drones and occasionally puts live recon teams into play. AMRU works hard to ensure information is up-to-date, using VIs to disseminate intel as quickly as possible.</String>
		<String id="715602">The Alliance's Sixth Fleet was traveling through Council space when Earth was invaded. The men and women on board watched helplessly as footage of the devastation rolled in. Their last order from Admiral Hackett was to avoid engagement and lay in reserve. After waiting for so long, the Sixth Fleet is eager to finally engage the enemy.</String>
		<String id="715603">The Illusive Man salvaged the most valuable part of the human proto-Reaper under construction by the Collectors: its central processor. This "brain" has been reactivated for use as a computational device, crunching unheard of amounts of data in nanoseconds. The Crucible's engineers are dissecting the processor, working in strictly supervised, drone-assisted shifts. While direct contact with Reapers is dangerous, the engineers feel the risk is worth the potential discovery of vulnerabilities in Reaper construction.</String>
		<String id="715604">After Commander Shepard destroyed the Collector base, Cerberus spent months picking through irradiated rubble for anything useful. The human proto-Reaper the Collectors were building lay in pieces. But its incomplete core survived. The power cell would have been capable of fueling a full-fledged Reaper. After studying the device, Cerberus modified it to fuel the Illusive Man's base. Alliance engineers believe they can use the core similarly to power the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="715605">Dr. Karin Chakwas served on board both the SSV Normandy and the Normandy SR-2 as resident doctor and primary medical researcher. A graduate of Earth's prestigious University of Mumbai, Chakwas's research background has allowed her to contribute to the effort to decode the Prothean device found on Mars: some of its material components require careful chemical analysis to ensure they are used properly in the cooling systems.</String>
		<String id="715606">A team of engineers working on the Normandy SR-2 developed the theory behind this piece of equipment. Dreadnought-class drive capacitors use specialized eezo-based compounds to channel and store thermal energy with greater efficiency than previous designs. These capacitors were quickly incorporated into the design of the device found in the Prothean Archives on Mars.</String>
		<String id="715607">Kelly Chambers contacted several former Cerberus engineers , convincing them--as a way to make up for their mistakes--to come out of hiding and help build the Crucible. Appalled at how Cerberus has turned on humanity, these Cerberus deserters have thrown themselves into their new task with a passion.</String>
		<String id="715608">When humanity began to expand its borders, experienced pilots were needed to establish colonies in the uncharted reaches of space. Some Alliance personnel heeded the call, and these luckless men and women have since been driven out of their colonies by the invading Reapers. After speaking with Lieutenant Steve Cortez, a few of these highly skilled fighter pilots agreed to fly against the enemies who destroyed their homes.</String>
		<String id="715609">No species can remain neutral during the Reaper conflict. Allied forces are recruiting anyone, soldier or mercenary, smart, fast, and tough enough to survive galactic war. The most experienced operatives form squads to secure objectives, evacuate civilians, and battle Cerberus or the Reapers deep in enemy territory. Initially led by N7 Alliance marines, these squads have been nicknamed the N7 Special Ops. In light of these teams' exemplary service and remarkable bravery, the Alliance has allowed this unofficial name to spread across the ranks as a sign of respect for their efforts.</String>
		<String id="715610">Biotic students from the Grissom Academy have joined the 103rd Marine Division as a support unit. The students focus their biotics into barriers that shield the marines and help control the flow of the battlefield.</String>
		<String id="715611">Centuries of krogan infighting abruptly halted with the news of a cure for the genophage. With their future restored, Tuchanka's clans have united in a show of force not seen since the Rachni War. The clans have also been stockpiling weapons of mass destruction for decades. Thankfully, their full destructive force can now be turned on the Reapers instead of Tuchanka. Their strength, size, and regenerative powers make the krogan ideal shock troops.</String>
		<String id="715612">With the death of Eve, the Clan Urdnot shaman who provided the basis for a genophage cure, several of the krogan clans have fallen into conflict over who was responsible for her death. The fighting, an excuse for many to act on long-standing feuds, has significantly weakened krogan forces.</String>
		<String id="715613">The explosion that rocked the Kelphic Valley killed every living creature within a 500-kilometer radius of the hidden bomb. All of the krogan clans gathering in the valley--which included males, females, and the rare krogan children--were wiped out in the blast.</String>
		<String id="715614">Clan Urdnot has become the unofficial, but uncontested, representative body of krogan power to the rest of the galaxy. Within the past decade, Urdnot's warriors have either absorbed or wiped out Clans Nakmor, Jurdon, Quash and even the legendarily ferocious Clan Raik. The discovery of a fertile Urdnot female rallied even more krogan, regardless of affiliation, to Urdnot's banner.</String>
		<String id="715615">Dr. Mordin Solus is an ex-STG operative who served with Commander Shepard's crew. A doctor, an expert geneticist, and an inventor, Professor Solus became the Normandy's resident technical specialist in the fight against the Collectors. He's now working with other scientists aboard the Crucible, lending his expertise to any problems in his field of study--and sometimes those out of it. His relentless application of logic to "impossible" obstacles on the Crucible has yielded surprisingly useful results.</String>
		<String id="715616">As the new Shadow Broker, Liara T'Soni has the loyalty of her predecessor's assassination squad, a small but lethal team of soldiers called on for the rare occasion when information isn't enough to silence a target. Their methods vary with each mission: from subtle poisonings to bombing entire buildings, the wet squad is dedicated to whatever range of destruction the new Broker requires. Dr. T'Soni has put them to work against the Reapers and Cerberus.</String>
		<String id="715617">Aralakh Company is led by Grunt, a genetically engineered "perfect soldier" who fought the Collectors with Commander Shepard. While young, the krogan has survived such brutal battles that the older warriors of the group have begrudgingly accepted his command.</String>
		<String id="715618">Grunt was appointed representative of Clan Urdnot in addition to becoming head of Aralakh Company, a political appointment not lost on the other clans. Grunt sees this new position as the first large victory he has won on his own--the respect of his people is difficult to come by.</String>
		<String id="715619">Wave after wave of rachni overwhelmed the Aralakh Company on Utukku. While fighting an impressive enemy to the death is considered an honorable end for a krogan, Aralakh Company has effectively been wiped out.</String>
		<String id="715620">While the Citadel Council officially dismissed the existence of the Reapers for years, high-level STG operatives harbored suspicions that their return might be imminent after the Battle of the Citadel. These leaders quietly began to advise the Special Tasks Group to prepare for the worst. In accordance, the STG is ready to deploy a sizable task force to deal with the Reaper threat.</String>
		<String id="715621">Admiral Xen, incensed after losing control of the geth, introduced a virus that shut them down in the middle of a pivotal battle. The virus was scrubbed, but not before the geth lost half of their forces.</String>
		<String id="715622">When Admiral Zaal'Koris's ship was destroyed, some Civilian Fleet captains panicked and attempted to flee the system. They were cut down by the geth before they could escape through the mass relay.</String>
		<String id="715623">Geth fighters attacked one of the liveships during the battle for Rannoch, significantly damaging one of the Civilian Fleet's most powerful vessels.</String>
		<String id="715624">The fleet sustained damage to several dozen frigates that were unable to repair themselves in time to avoid destruction during the war for Rannoch.</String>
		<String id="715625">The Patrol Fleet sacrificed several of its ships to take the brunt of the geth's attacks on the Heavy Fleet, buying the Heavy Fleet time to repair its frigates and launch a successful counterattack.</String>
		<String id="715626">When Xen's research began to cost lives, Commander Shepard killed her before she could turn more people into test subjects.</String>
		<String id="715627">Admiral Xen's research teams salvaged advanced AI relays from the wreckage of the geth's dreadnought flagship. Xen used the valuable technology to write a custom VI that oversees the energy output of the Crucible's fusion reactors and adjusts itself automatically.</String>
		<String id="715628">The last reports from the AEC were little more than officers screaming about rachni flooding into their barracks, scything through unsuspecting scientists. After a brave, but brief, battle, the core of the Alliance Engineering Corps was wiped out by their traitorous alien "allies."</String>
		<String id="715629">This fleet lost a third of its vessels protecting the Council during the Battle of the Citadel two years ago. Unfortunately, the Alliance did not have time to rebuild the fleet to its previous strength before the Reapers invaded.</String>
		<String id="715630">After discovering that the cure for the genophage was sabotaged, Urdnot Wrex angrily ordered the krogan to withdraw support from Shepard's forces. Tuchanka's clans have hunkered down on their homeworld, determined to defend themselves while watching the rest of the galaxy burn.</String>
		<String id="715631">An Alliance rear admiral once unfairly dismissed the salarian Third Fleet as nothing more than "an over-abundance of spy-planes." While the salarians rely heavily on gathering intelligence in any war, the Third Fleet's firepower is comparable to any other major naval force. Its vessels use the latest GARDIAN defense systems, with improved tracking algorithms to handle a greater number of projectiles than older models. Even its scouting flotillas have been armed with hull-mounted Thanix cannons, developed in conjunction with the turian military.</String>
		<String id="715632">Miranda Lawson is an ex-Cerberus operative. At Cerberus, her intelligence, dedication, and leadership impressed the Illusive Man, who assigned her to head the Lazarus Cell team that brought Commander Shepard back to life. Lawson brings extensive knowledge of the Illusive Man's dealings to the Alliance, directing them toward several clandestine Cerberus operations. A skilled shot and a gifted biotic, Lawson is as comfortable in a pitched battle as she is in a boardroom.</String>
		<String id="715633">Many krogan went fortune-seeking out in the lawless Terminus systems. Their imposing bulk and infamous brutality won them prized positions as bodyguards and mercenaries. When news of a genophage cure spread, these drifters were contacted by their clans and urged to join Shepard's forces against the Reapers. After centuries of aimless brawls and bleak futures, krogan everywhere are heeding the call.</String>
		<String id="715634">After Admiral Xen's experiments took a decidedly unethical turn, Commander Shepard placed her under arrest, on the condition that she use her talents to develop delivery systems to unleash the Crucible's destructive potential.</String>
		<String id="715635">These schematics were downloaded from the Geth Consensus. They appear to be designs for improved resistor terminals in geth platforms. The schematics can easily be built into human-sized armor, providing the wearer combat benefits enjoyed by the geth. The resistors can be tweaked either to increase the wearer's damage output, or improve their shields.</String>
		<String id="715636">This data was discovered and downloaded from inside the Geth Consensus. Thousands of these miniaturized capacitors were installed beside armor power cells, where they can instantly discharge a stored boost of energy. This boost can be tweaked either to speed up shield regeneration, or the rate at which tech, biotic, and combat powers can be used.</String>
		<String id="715637">This advanced amp is a sophisticated biofeedback system that interfaces with a set of armor's microcomputers. The amp can be set to help streamline the use of biotic skills and combat powers, or increase their damage instead.</String>
		<String id="715638">Spectres are the left hand of the Citadel, enforcing laws and stopping crimes with galactic repercussions. While Spectres usually work alone, the Reaper threat gave cause for these extraordinary agents to assemble in an elite unit capable of operating in enemy territory without backup. Spectre Jondum Bau, while not their official leader, is the group's spokesperson. He has passed on important intelligence gather by the unit to Hackett and the Fifth Fleet.</String>
		<String id="715639">Kasumi Goto is wanted in over a dozen systems for sabotage, hacking, theft, and a laundry list of other crimes. The Alliance is willing to overlook Goto's indiscretions in exchange for her help with the Crucible. In addition to her expertise with electronic security systems, Goto can acquire important technology thought lost or stuck deep in enemy territory. No one dares ask how she acquires these items.</String>
		<String id="715640">Zaeed Massani has a reputation as one of the most relentless and efficient mercenaries in the Terminus Systems. Cerberus contacted Massani a few months after the Collectors were destroyed and offered him a job. Negotiations ended badly, and Massani now seeks out jobs that oppose his former employer's interests. He brings years of experience and finely honed survival skills to the fight against the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="715641">Volus prefer airpower in conflicts, counting on the turians for ground support. They maintain several flotillas of heavy-bomber frigates capable of warfare in any atmosphere.</String>
		<String id="715642">Published years ago by Dr. Conrad Verner, this doctorial dissertation on xenotechnology is a lengthy but intriguing argument that dark energy causes a minute but empirically observable difference in the passage of time. Hotly debated when first published, the paper's theory is supported by recent data. The dissertation illuminates several instructions left by the Protheans on how to build the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="715643">Dr. Verner found additional schematics useful in the creation of the device. After passing the data on to the Alliance, he added Commander Shepard to the dissertation's list of acknowledgments.</String>
		<String id="715644">The hanar have sent their warships to engage the Reapers to repay Commander Shepard for saving their homeworld. Though their navy is relatively small, the hanar have also provided the services of their best drell combat specialists. They are accomplished spies, saboteurs and assassins, trained at an extremely young age. While the hanar are normally loath to send trusted allies into open warfare, these are desperate times.</String>
		<String id="715645">Alliance News Network reporter Diana Allers has been broadcasting from the Normandy, interviewing crew members and high-ranking Alliance officers to give the galaxy an "insider's view" of the war.</String>
		<String id="715646">When the original SSV Normandy was destroyed, Cerberus rebuilt the ship from stolen Alliance plans. Dubbed the SR-2, the Alliance took the new Normandy apart and refitted some of its systems with new technology of its own. As a result, the SR-2 Normandy is the highest-performing frigate in the entire Alliance navy, and possibly the fastest ship in its class. The Normandy is commanded by Shepard, an Alliance officer and humanity's first Spectre.</String>
		<String id="715647">To bolster the Normandy's firepower, Commander Shepard installed a Thanix Magnetic-Hydrodynamic Cannon on the ship's undercarriage. Based on Reaper technology, the powerful weapon fires molten metal accelerated to a fraction of the speed of light.</String>
		<String id="715648">The Normandy's thermal pipes divert heat from an overloading engine core, preventing the core from venting into the ship's engineering compartment.</String>
		<String id="715649">When Cerberus attacked the turian colony on Aephus, the Sixth Fleet flew in to reclaim the planet. They succeeded, but lost several ships in the attempt.</String>
		<String id="715650">Crates of dextro-amino acid medi-gel have been shipped out to the turian Seventh Fleet. This resupply will help turian medics treat potentially fatal wounds.</String>
		<String id="715651">A group of asari mercenaries, "sent by a matriarch friend of the Commander," have volunteered their services. They'll ride with the Second Fleet, deploying to combat zones as required.</String>
		<String id="715652">The once-formidable batarian navy was all but annihilated when the Reapers struck Khar'shan. The enraged survivors have gathered into a single remaining fleet. Batarian refugees are enlisting by the thousands, desperate for a sense of purpose after the destruction of their homeworld. No collection of vessels is more eager to engage the Reapers than Khar'shan's last warships.</String>
		<String id="715653">Blaming humanity for the destruction of one of the batarian worlds, a batarian military officer has waged a campaign of sabotage against the Alliance. He hacked into Alliance ship systems, causing them to crash or lose oxygen in flight.</String>
		<String id="715654">As the highest-ranking officer left in the Hegemony, Balak is now the last batarian military leader. His leadership, drive, and barely contained fury have galvanized his troops. While Balak bears a deep hatred for the Alliance, he would do anything to save his people, and has grudgingly joined forces with humanity to stop the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="715655">Her reports stress the bravery and sacrifice of the Earth's System Alliance. They drive up recruitment numbers among human viewers exempt from drafts, mainly colonists in the Attican Traverse.</String>
		<String id="715656">Her reports reveal the worst Cerberus atrocities, whipping up public outrage in non-human viewers to drive up alien recruitment.</String>
		<String id="715657">Before taking on the Collectors, Commander Shepard reinforced the Normandy's superstructure with Silaris armor. This protective layer of carbon nanotube sheeting can withstand temperatures that would instantly vaporize more conventional armor.</String>
		<String id="715658">The Normandy has been upgraded with Cyclonic Barrier Technology, allowing the ship's mass effect field projectors to fire rapidly oscillating barriers that deflect rather than directly absorb kinetic shocks.</String>
		<String id="715659">Some of Grissom Academy's more technically minded students were saved from Cerberus by Commander Shepard. They've met up with Sanders, contributing their brainpower to some of the problems she's been tackling.</String>
		<String id="715660">David Archer is another refugee from Grissom Academy working on the device . Despite his youth, Archer's theories on interstellar cross-modulation have won him respect with the project's scientists.</String>
		<String id="715661">Commander Shepard uncovered significant elemental deposits while scanning planets with the Normandy SR-2. When the Alliance dry-docked the Normandy, they seized all recovered elements. This material surplus has gone toward building the Prothean device discovered on Mars.</String>
		<String id="715662">This fish is a rare and valuable subspecies of the prejek paddlefish, prized for its rich and savory flavor. The breed is endangered, and a member of the Hanar Illuminated Primacy is offering a choice of rewards in exchange for the fish.</String>
		<String id="715663">Matriarch Gallae was an asari of some importance, with connections to Asari High Command and the Council itself. Her electronic signature can be used once before security protocols realize it has been activated by someone else. Gallae's contacts can open elite training facilities for reconditioning soldiers, or on behalf of the asari embassy, grant someone a discount at all Citadel stores.</String>

The Alliance wishes to express its gratitude for your assistance. With the information you've been sending us on Cerberus, we've been able to avoid ambushes they were setting up for our supply convoys.

We'd offer you additional resources, but I understand you've procured a class-F private fighter and joined up with former colleagues. I also understand that several Cerberus bases were lost after being attacked by a reported group of "private special operatives" of no known affiliation.

The Alliance cannot officially condone this kind of independent operation, nor do we actually confirm that these operations are taking place. 

Good luck, Ms. Lawson.</String>

		<String id="718079">Terra Nova was one of the Class-1 colonization prospects discovered by the first wave of Alliance surveys in 2150. It was the second human extrasolar colony, and the first beyond the Charon mass relay. It once boasted the highest population of any formally endorsed Alliance colony, but in recent years threats of batarian attack caused many to emigrate. The name "Exodus Cluster" became all too apt.

The Reapers landed on Terra Nova after a brief battle with the Alliance's Sixth Fleet. Aware that it would lose, the fleet retreated in hopes of meeting with allies and retaking the planet. Intelligence indicates that the Reaper force here is light, and debate rages over whether to try to liberate the planet, or if such an effort would prove futile if the Reapers sent reinforcements.

		<String id="718589">Borr is a hydrogen-helium gas giant with over 90 moons. The light of ionized hydrogen filtering through an upper cloud deck of sodium causes its striking coloration. The source of the ionization has not yet been confirmed, but Borr's mass (equal to six Jupiters) and high temperature suggest it may be a "brown dwarf," a gas giant that gained almost enough mass to ignite into a small star.

The Reapers destroyed Borr's extensive helium-3 infrastructure, although wreckage indicates that the Sixth Fleet did not give up the planet without a fight.

While a potential target for terraforming, the proximity of the "shirt-sleeves habitable" Terra Nova relegated Tyr to a support role.

Nearly one hundred corporations--human and alien--constructed tele-operated mining, refining, and manufacturing facilities across the planet. The Reapers immediately targeted these, seeking to cut off the Alliance's supply of hydrogen fuel cells.

The rough, varied terrain suggests an ancient cataclysm caused significant damage to the planet. Reaching 6.5 AU at perigee and 7.1 AU at apogee, Loki's unusual elliptical orbit reinforces this hypothesis.

Beneath Loki's ice cap runs a naturally formed network of subterranean tunnels. These may have proven useful to Alliance forces in retreat. Nevertheless, any organics hidden here remain in peril, as Loki's atmosphere is inhospitable and Reaper scanning technology is efficient.

		<String id="719726">With the discovery of a network of ancient cosmic relays in the 21st century, humanity was thrust into a universe teeming with alien life. At its heart lay the Citadel, the galactic capital for all space-faring races. It had once been inhabited by a species known as the Protheans, who mysteriously vanished 50,000 years ago, leaving behind warnings of a godlike race of machines that had destroyed them. This enemy had a name--the Reapers--and the warnings claimed they would return again to harvest organic life in a never-ending cycle of destruction.

One soldier chose to heed those warnings. In 2183, Commander Shepard, captain of the Alliance warship Normandy, destroyed the vanguard of the next Reaper invasion in a fierce battle for the Citadel. But Shepard's victory was only temporary. A vast Reaper armada remained, patiently waiting in the voids of dark space to launch their next attack.

Two years later, Shepard was mortally wounded on a routine mission. Cerberus, a pro-human terrorist organization, recovered and resurrected Shepard. Led by the shadowy Illusive Man, Cerberus recognized that the Reapers would soon threaten humanity. Enlisting Shepard's help, along with a colorful crew of scientists, soldiers, and outlaws, the Normandy launched a suicide mission beyond the fabled Omega 4 relay to once again confront the Reaper menace. Yet even this triumph was only a delaying action in a much bigger war--a war that was about to engulf the entire Milky Way...</String>

		<String id="719738">In the early 2160s, the Alliance began aggressive colonization of worlds in the Skyllian Verge, much to the dismay of the batarians who had been developing the region for several decades. In 2171, the batarians petitioned the Council to declare the Verge a "zone of batarian interest." The Council refused, however, declaring unsettled worlds in the region open to human colonization.

In protest, the batarians closed their Citadel embassy and severed official diplomatic relations with the Council, effectively becoming a rogue state. They instigated a proxy war in the Verge by funneling money and weapons to criminal organizations, urging them to strike at human colonies.

Hostilities peaked with the Skyllian Blitz of 2176, an attack on the human capital of Elysium by batarian-funded pirates and slavers. In 2178, the Alliance retaliated with a crushing assault on the moon of Torfan, long used as a staging base by batarian-backed criminals. In the aftermath, the batarians retreated into their own systems, and are now rarely seen in Citadel space.</String>

		<String id="719740">Two centuries ago, the hanar helped 375,000 members of the drell race migrate to the hanar homeworld, Kahje, to escape the environmental extermination that had claimed the remaining 11 billion drell.

Nearly all drell demonstrate tremendous loyalty to their famously reclusive saviors. The intimacy of their relationship, expressed in a formal sociopolitical alliance called the Compact, also results in extremely close personal relations in which some drell actually learn hanar Soul names. While most drell reside on Kahje, some assist hanar off-world as envoys, researchers, co-investors, wayfarers, assassins or otherwise, eager to help their saviors. For a century, galactic wisdom has held that behind any high-ranking hanar hides a resourceful and fanatically devoted drell.

The omnivorous, reptilian drell possess an average life span of 85 galactic standard years. Having evolved on an arid planet, drell face serious illness on the hanar homeworld, especially Kepral's Syndrome, a fatal bacterial lung disease.</String>

		<String id="719742">The elcor are a Citadel species native to the high-gravity world Dekuuna. They are massive creatures, standing on four muscular legs for increased stability. Elcor move slowly, an evolved response to an environment where a fall can be lethal. This has colored their psychology, making them deliberate and conservative.

Elcor speech is ponderous and monotone. Among themselves, scent, slight movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor often go out of their way to clarify when they are being sarcastic, amused, or angry.

Dekuuna's high gravity impedes mountain formation. Most of the world consists of flat, open plains, which prehistoric elcor wandered across in small family bands. Modern elcor still prefer open sky, and can become restless and uncomfortable on long starship journeys.</String>
		<String id="719743">Elcor</String>
		<String id="719744">The geth are a humanoid race of networked AIs. They were created by the quarians 300 years ago as tools of labor and war. When the geth showed signs of self-evolution, the quarians attempted to exterminate them. The geth won the resulting war. This example has led to legal, systematic repression of artificial intelligences in galactic society.

The geth possess a unique distributed intelligence. An individual has rudimentary animal instincts, but as their numbers and proximity increase, the apparent intelligence of each individual improves. In groups, they can reason, analyze situations, and use tactics as well as any organic race. 

Geth space is located at the trailing end of the Perseus Arm, beyond the lawless Terminus Systems. The Perseus Veil, an obscuring 'dark nebula' of opaque gas and dust, lies between their space and the Terminus Systems.</String>
		<String id="719745">Geth</String>
		<String id="719746">The hanar are a Citadel species known for excessive politeness. They speak with scrupulous precision, and take offense at improper language. Hanar that expect to deal with other species take special courses to help them unlearn their tendency to take offense at improper speech.

All hanar have two names. The Face Name is known to the world; the Soul Name is kept for use among close friends and relations. Hanar never refer to themselves in the first person in conversation with someone they know on a Face Name basis. To do so is considered egotistical, so instead they refer to themselves as "this one," or the impersonal "it."

Their homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of clouds. Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on the world, many hanar worship them, and hanar myths often speak of an elder race that civilized them by teaching them language.</String>
		<String id="719747">Hanar</String>
		<String id="719748">When the asari discovered the Citadel, they also discovered the keepers, a docile multi-limbed insect race that seemingly exists only to maintain and repair the great Prothean station.

Early attempts to communicate with or study the keepers were failures, and it is now illegal to interfere with or impede keeper activity. Because they are completely nonthreatening, keepers have become virtually invisible to everyone else. Similarly, they seem indifferent to other species, except for their tendency to help new arrivals integrate themselves into the Citadel.

No matter how many keepers die due to old age, violence, or accident, they maintain a constant number. No one has discovered the source of new keepers, but some hypothesize they are genetic constructs: biological androids created somewhere deep in the inaccessible core of the Citadel itself.</String>
		<String id="719749">Keepers</String>
		<String id="719750">The krogan evolved in a hostile and vicious environment. Until the invention of gunpowder weapons, "eaten by predators" was still the number one cause of krogan fatalities. Afterwards, it was "death by gunshot."

When the salarians discovered them, the krogan were a brutal, primitive species struggling to survive a self-inflicted nuclear winter. The salarians culturally uplifted them, teaching them to use and build modern technology so they could serve as soldiers in the Rachni War. 

Liberated from the harsh conditions of their homeworld, the quick-breeding krogan experienced an unprecedented population explosion. They began to colonize nearby worlds, even though these worlds were already inhabited. The Krogan Rebellions lasted nearly a century, only ending when the turians unleashed the genophage, a salarian-developed bioweapon that crushed all krogan resistance.

The genophage makes only one in 1,000 pregnancies viable, and today the krogan are a slowly dying breed. Understandably, the krogan harbor a grudge against all other species, especially the turians.</String>
		<String id="719751">Krogan</String>
		<String id="719752">Driven from their home system by the geth nearly three centuries ago, most quarians now live aboard the Migrant Fleet, a flotilla of 50,000 vessels ranging in size from passenger shuttles to mobile space stations. 

Home to 17 million quarians, the flotilla understandably has scarce resources. Because of this, each quarian must go on a rite of passage know as the Pilgrimage when they come of age. They leave the fleet and only return once they have found something of value they can bring back to their people.

Other species tend to look down on the quarians for creating the geth and for the negative impact their fleet has when it enters a system. This has led to many myths and rumors about the quarians, including the belief that underneath their clothes and breathing masks, they are actually cybernetic creatures: a combination of organic and synthetic parts.</String>
		<String id="719753">Quarians</String>
		<String id="719754">The volus are a member species of the Citadel with their own embassy, but they are also a client race of the turians. Centuries ago, they were voluntarily absorbed into the Hierarchy, effectively trading their mercantile prowess for turian military protection.

Irune, their homeworld, lies far beyond the normal life zone of its star. However, the world has a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere that traps enough heat to support an ammonia-based biochemistry. As a result, the volus must wear pressure suits and breathers when dealing with other species as conventional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually split open.

Volus culture is tribal, bartering lands and even people to gain status. This culture of exchange inclines them to economic pursuits. It was the volus who authored the Unified Banking Act, and they continue to monitor and balance the Citadel economy.</String>

		<String id="719757">Thresher maws are subterranean carnivores that spend their entire lives eating or searching for something to eat. Threshers reproduce via spores that can lie dormant for millennia, yet are robust enough to survive prolonged periods in deep space and atmospheric re-entry. As a result, thresher spores appear on many worlds, spread by previous generations of space travelers.

The body of a thresher never entirely leaves the ground; only the head and tentacles erupt from the earth to attack. In addition to physical attacks, threshers have the ability to project toxic chemicals and emit bursts of infrasound as a shockwave weapon.

The Alliance first encountered threshers on the colony of Akuze in 2177. After contact was lost with the pioneer team, marine units were deployed to investigate. The shore parties were set upon by hungry threshers, and nearly the entire assault force was killed. Alliance forces recommend engaging threshers with vehicle-mounted heavy weapons.</String>

		<String id="719760">The Citadel is an ancient deep-space station, presumably constructed by the Protheans. Since the Prothean extinction, numerous species have come to call the Citadel home. It serves as the political, cultural, and financial capital of the galactic community. To represent their interests, most species maintain embassies on the Presidium, the Citadel's inner ring. 

The Citadel Tower, in the center of the Presidium, holds the Citadel Council chambers. Council affairs often have far-reaching effects on the rest of the galactic community. Five arms, known as the wards, extend from the Presidium. Their inner surfaces have been built into cities, populated by millions of inhabitants from across the galaxy.

The Citadel is virtually indestructible. If attacked, the station can close its arms to form a solid, impregnable shell. For as long as the station has existed, an enigmatic race called the keepers has maintained it.</String>
		<String id="719761">Citadel</String>
		<String id="719766">Spectres are agents from the Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance and answer only to the Citadel Council. They are elite military operatives, granted the authority to deal with threats to peace and stability in whatever way they deem necessary.

They operate independently or in groups of two or three. Some are empathetic peacekeepers, resolving disputes through diplomacy. Others are cold-blooded assassins, ruthlessly dispatching problem individuals. All get the job done, one way or another, often operating outside the bounds of galactic law.

The Spectres were founded after the salarians joined the Council. For many years, they operated in secrecy as back-room "problem solvers." Only after the Krogan Rebellions did their activities become publicized. Assignment of a Spectre is less contentious than a military deployment but makes it clear that the Council is concerned about a situation.</String>
		<String id="719767">Spectres</String>
		<String id="719770">The Systems Alliance is an independent supranational government representing the interests of humanity as a whole. The Alliance is responsible for the governance and defense of all extra-solar colonies and stations.

The Alliance grew out of the various national space programs as a matter of practicality. Sol's planets had been explored and exploited through piecemeal national efforts. The expense of colonizing entire new solar systems could not be met by any one country. With humans knowing that alien contact was inevitable, there was enough political will to jointly fund an international effort.

Still, the Alliance was often disregarded by those on Earth until the First Contact War. While the national governments dithered and bickered over who should lead the effort to liberate Shanxi, the Alliance fleet struck decisively. Post-War public approval gave the Alliance the credibility to establish its own Parliament and become the galactic face of humanity.</String>

The Alliance gained associate membership to the Citadel Council in 2165 and full membership in 2183, with Ambassador David Anderson representing humanity.

Human political-economic relationships vary between combative and lucrative. The turians who'd fought humans during the 2157 First Contact War have become valuable trade partners, despite residual social hostility. 

Other relationships are even more complicated. The rapid rise of human political influence on the Council--achieving in decades what others waited or are still waiting centuries to acquire--has galvanized suspicion and resentment against humanity. That negativity is vastly outweighed by the respect and trust humanity earned by saving the Council during the 2183 attack on the Citadel, at the cost of Alliance cruisers Cairo, Cape Town, Emden, Jakarta, Madrid, Seoul, Shenyang, and Warsaw and their 2400 crew.</String>

The Alliance gained associate membership to the Citadel Council in 2165 and assumed leadership in 2183, with former Ambassador Donnel Udina presiding.

Many species regard humanity as a rogue race and its 2183 victory following the attack on Eden Prime as a brutal and calculated sacrifice of its military rivals. Humans allegedly leveraged military victory into a political one, carving associate membership out of the deaths of the Council.

Because of the human Spectre Shepard's pivotal role in defending the Citadel, many analysts conclude several humans will be made candidates for Spectre status, further solidifying the human contribution to galactic peace.

By achieving in decades what others waited centuries to receive, especially after so bloody a conflict, humans have guaranteed themselves deep hostility and fear throughout the galaxy.</String>

The armor is nearly unsurpassed in strength because its central material, carbon nanotube sheets woven with diamond Chemical Vapor Deposition, are crushed by mass effect fields into super-dense layers able to withstand extreme temperatures. That process also compensates for diamond's brittleness.

Diamond armor itself has two limiting disadvantages. First, while nanotubes and CVD-diamond construction have become cheaper in recent years, it remains prohibitively expensive to coat starships or aircraft larger than fighters in Silaris material. Second, the armor must be attached to the ship's superstructure, so shock waves from massive firepower can still destroy the metals beneath the armor itself.

A popular misconception holds that the diamond composition of Silaris armor gives it a sparkle. In fact, atmospheric nitrogen impurities during the super-hot forging process give the armor a metallic gray or yellow sheen.

		<String id="719782">Cyclonic Barrier Technology (CBT) attempts to solve the higher-end limitations of traditional kinetic barriers. Traditional barriers cannot block high-level kinetic energy attacks such as disruptor torpedoes because torpedo mass effect fields add mass. The CBT violently slaps aside rather than halting incoming linear force. By rotationally firing their mass effect field projectors, ships create rapidly oscillating kinetic barriers instead of static ones. Shooting through the CBT is like trying to shoot at a target inside a spinning ball.

Significant drawbacks to current CBT configuration prevent its use on anything other than frigates and fighters. Its many high-frequency sensors and emitters require frequent maintenance and replacement. A partially damaged CBT can endanger its operator, who is surrounded by rotating mass effect fields skewing in unpredictable directions. Fortunately, if an emitter is damaged, the CBT corrects to become a traditional shield array, a safety feature that makes it most effective during opening volleys.

Intense training and surgically implanted amplifiers are necessary for a biotic to produce mass effect fields powerful enough for practical use. The relative strength of biotic abilities varies greatly among species and with each individual.

There are three branches of biotics. Telekinesis uses mass-lowering fields to levitate or impel objects. Mass-raising Kinetic Fields are used to block or pin objects. Distortion uses rapidly shifting mass fields to shred objects.

Most organic species are capable of developing biotic abilities, though there are risks involved. Biotics are the result of in-utero exposure to element zero. This usually causes fatal cancers in the victim, but in rare cases it coalesces into nodules within the fetus's developing nervous system.</String>

With a negative current, mass is decreased. The stronger the current, the greater the magnitude of the dark energy mass effect.

In space, low-mass fields allow FTL travel and inexpensive surface-to-orbit transit. High-mass fields create artificial gravity and push space debris away from vessels. In manufacturing, low-mass fields permit the creation of evenly blended alloys, while high mass compaction creates dense, sturdy construction materials.

Versatile and reliable, an omni-tool can be used to analyze and adjust the functionality of most standard equipment, including weapons and armor, from a distance.

The fabrication module can rapidly assemble small three-dimensional objects from common, reusable industrial plastics, ceramics, and light alloys. This allows for field repairs and modifications to most standard items, as well as the reuse of salvaged equipment.

Once applied, the gel is designed to grip tight to flesh until subjected to a frequency of ultrasound. It is sealable against liquids--most notably blood--as well as contaminants and gases.

The gel is a genetically engineered bioplasm created by the Sirta Foundation, a medical technology megacorp based on Earth. Technically, medi-gel violates Council laws against genetic engineering, but so far, it has proved far too useful to ban.</String>

		<String id="719803">Reaper "indoctrination" is an insidious means of corrupting organic minds, "reprogramming" the brain through physical and psychological conditioning using electromagnetic fields, infrasonic and ultrasonic noise, and other subliminal methods. The Reaper's resulting control over the limbic system leaves the victim highly susceptible to its suggestions.

Organics undergoing indoctrination may complain of headaches and buzzing or ringing in their ears. As time passes, they have feelings of "being watched" and hallucinations of "ghostly" presences. Ultimately, the Reaper gains the ability to use the victim's body to amplify its signals, manifesting as "alien" voices in the mind.

Indoctrination can create perfect deep cover agents. A Reaper's "suggestions" can manipulate victims into betraying friends, trusting enemies, or viewing the Reaper itself with superstitious awe. Should a Reaper subvert a well-placed political or military leader, the resulting chaos can bring down nations.

Long-term physical effects of the manipulation are unsustainable. Higher mental functioning decays, ultimately leaving the victim a gibbering animal. Rapid indoctrination is possible, but causes this decay in days or weeks. Slow, patient indoctrination allows the thrall to last for months or years.</String>

They are believed to have built the mass relays and the Citadel, which have allowed numerous species to explore and expand throughout the galaxy.

Prothean ruins are found on worlds across the galaxy. While surprisingly intact for their age, functioning examples of Prothean paleotechnology are rare. Time and generations of looters have picked their dead cities and derelict stations clean.

Some believe the Protheans meddled in the evolution of younger races. The hanar homeworld of Kahje, for example, shows clear evidence of former Prothean occupation. The presence of a former Prothean observation post on Mars has caused a rebirth of 'interventionary evolutionists' among humans.

When the salarians arrived, it was the asari who proposed the establishment of the Citadel Council to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. Since then, the asari have served as the mediators and centrists of the Council.

An all-female race, the asari reproduce through a form of parthenogenesis. Each asari can attune her nervous system to that of another individual of any gender, and of any species, to reproduce. This capability has led to unseemly and inaccurate rumors about asari promiscuity.

Asari can live for over 1,000 years, passing through three stages of life. In the Maiden stage, they wander restlessly, seeking new knowledge and experience. When the Matron stage begins, they 'meld' with interesting partners to produce their offspring. This ends when they reach the Matriarch stage, where they assume the roles of leaders and councilors.</String>

		<String id="719816">The second species to join the Citadel, the salarians are warm-blooded amphibians with a hyperactive metabolism. Salarians think fast, talk fast, and move fast. To salarians, other species seem sluggish and dull-witted. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short life span; salarians over the age of 40 are a rarity.

The salarians were responsible for advancing the development of the primitive krogan species to use as soldiers during the Rachni Wars. They were also behind the creation of the genophage bioweapon the turians used to quell the Krogan Rebellions several centuries later.

Salarians are known for their observational capability and nonlinear thinking. This manifests as an aptitude for research and espionage. They are constantly experimenting and inventing, and it is generally accepted that they always know more than they're letting on.</String>

As their territory and influence has spread, the turians have come to rely on the salarians for military intelligence and the asari for diplomacy. Despite a somewhat colonial attitude towards the rest of the galaxy, the ruling Hierarchy understands they would lose more than they would gain if the other two races were ever removed. 

Turians come from an autocratic society that values discipline and possesses a strong sense of personal and collective honor. There is lingering animosity between turians and humans over the First Contact War of 2157, which is known as the 'Relay 314 Incident' to the turians.

Instead, Ardat-Yakshi electro-chemically ravage their partners' nervous systems, in extreme cases leaving victims as vegetative invalids or corpses. Asari psychologists regard this incapacity for mental fusion as preventing the development of empathy, leading to psychopathy. There is no known cure.

The disorder generally begins in infancy, reaching full pathology during Maiden adolescent sexual development. While seductive and sexually driven as other asari, Ardat-Yakshi are congenitally sterile.

Ancient asari mythology held Ardat-Yakshi as gods of destruction, depicting them as villains of countless legends and as the antiheroes of numerous asari epics.

Contrary to popular belief, Ardat-Yakshi are neither extremely rare (around one per cent of asari dwell on the AY spectrum), nor are they all murderers. Most cultivate and discard countless exploitative or abusive relationships during their legally marginal lives. Despite rumors of Ardat-Yakshi syndicates, by nature Ardat-Yakshi are incapable of long-term cooperation.

As a disproportionately wealthy species, asari employ their economic reach and media ownership to hide the AY pathology from the galactic community, placing most Ardat-Yakshi in monitored work programs or seclusion. Only the most aggressive cases are sentenced to sanitaria and prisons or to the execution lists of justicars.

A group of yahg is unable to cooperate until a single leader has been determined through either social maneuvering or brute force, but no grudges are held once a yahg establishes dominance. Former rivals serve their new superior's purpose with unflinching loyalty and relentless determination, a legacy of their origin as pack species. 

Their eight eyes are another sign of their hunter ancestry--all four pairs are geared toward tracking down and predicting the movements of prey. Sophisticated and keenly developed sensitivity to movement and light have made yahg masters at reading body language, regardless of species. Much to their short-lived chagrin, the Council's first contact teams discovered it was nearly impossible to lie to the yahg.

The yahg had technology equivalent to 20th century Earth standards when they were discovered by the Council in 2125. The Council's ambassadors approached the yahg as friends and allies instead of subordinates, a baffling sign of contempt from newcomers on Parnack. The yahg attacked when it became apparent that the alien diplomats stubbornly considered themselves sovereign people instead of new underlings. Parnack remains off-limits by order of the Council, which fears that the yahg's size, aggression, and obsession with control make them poorly suited for integration into the galactic community.</String>

In reality, Collectors are human-sized insectoid bipeds and can resemble massive winged beetles. They are a terrifying force in the galaxy, responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands.

Collectors generate permanent stasis fields around themselves, creating nightmarish red-shifted energy fields. In battle, they hold position whenever possible, relying on their aggressive biotics and nearly limitless power. Several types of bipedal Collectors have been identified, including minions, defenders, zealots, assassins and artillery-operators.

Acting together, Collectors have imprisoned entire cities in stasis. While no definitive forensic accounting exists to explain the fate of those imprisoned, leading speculation is that victims are harvested for scientific experimentation and neurobiological repurposing.</String>

They are humanoid in form, but vorcha have "clusters" of nondifferentiated neoblast cells, like those of Earth's planarian worms. Damaged vorcha cells mature into specialized structures to alleviate injury or stress. Transformations include thicker skin following injury, lung adaptation for barely breathable atmospheres, and stronger cardio-skeletal muscle under high gravity. Skull capacity and brain size do not change, and vorcha rarely make more than one somatic overhaul.
 
Vorcha assault each other frequently, causing their young to gain strength, intelligence, and resilience. As a result, vorcha see inflicting and receiving pain as normal communication. Few vorcha study professions, in part because their average life expectancy is only 20 years. Because vorcha can eat and breathe nearly anything, they can live almost anywhere, but racism prevents them from integrating into most societies that dismiss them as vermin. They have few employment options beyond krogan mercenary bands.</String>

Originally native to the krogan homeworld of Tuchanka, they are, like most life from Tuchanka, savage, clannish, and consummate survivors. They are pack hunters when vulnerable prey is readily available and become scavengers when outnumbered or outclassed.

Their supreme adaptability, vicious demeanor, and rapid breeding cycle have made them ubiquitous and dangerous pests on many worlds. Virtually everywhere the krogan have been, varren infestations have followed, wreaking havoc with the native ecology. 

The krogan have had a love-hate relationship with varren for millennia, alternately fighting them for territory and embracing them as treasured companions. To this day, krogan raise them as beasts of war. A common subgenus of varren has metallic silver scales, leading to the rather unusual nickname "fishdogs."</String>

		<String id="719857">After the Rachni War, the quick-breeding krogan expanded at the expense of their neighbors. Warlords leveraged their veteran soldiers to seize living space while the Council races were still grateful. Over centuries, the krogan conquered world after world. There was always "just one more" needed. When the Council finally demanded withdrawal from the asari colony of Lusia, krogan Overlord Kredak stormed off the Citadel, daring the Council to take their worlds back.

But the Council had taken precautions. The finest STG operators and asari huntresses had been drafted into a covert "observation force," the Office of Special Tactics and Reconnaissance. The Spectres opened the war with crippling strategic strikes. Krogan planets went dark as computer viruses flooded the extranet. Sabotaged antimatter refineries disappeared in blue-white annihilation. Headquarters stations shattered into orbit-clogging debris, rammed by pre-placed suicide freighters.

Still, this only delayed the inevitable. The war would have been lost if not for first contact with the turians, who responded to krogan threats with a prompt declaration of war. Being on the far side of krogan space from the Council, the turians advanced rapidly into the lightly defended krogan rear areas. The krogan responded by dropping space stations and asteroids on turian colonies. Three worlds were rendered completely uninhabitable.

This was precisely the wrong approach to take with the turians. Each is first and foremost a public servant, willing to risk his life to protect his comrades. Rather than increasing public war weariness, krogan tactics stiffened turian resolve.

The arrival of turian task forces saved many worlds from the warlords' marauding fleets, but it took development of the genophage bioweapon to end the war. There were decades of unrest afterwards. Rogue warlords and holdout groups of insurgents refused to surrender, or disappeared into the frontier systems to become pirates.</String>

Influenced by asari and salarian military doctrine, Eclipse specializes in sabotage, assassination, and personal and organizational security. Although Citadel governments regard the corporation with suspicion, it's embraced in the Skyllian Verge and Terminus Systems.

Early on, Sederis sought government contracts to establish market share against the better-established Blue Suns. Her agency scored a galactic PR coup by retaking several space stations captured by the Anhur People's Liberation Army and neutralizing its leaders, a victory Eclipse's marketing department never ceases trumpeting.

Based on Omega Station, Eclipse controls nearly 20% of the asteroid's real estate. Its services range from mech repair to open warfare, although assassination is reserved for meeting wider, longer-term company goals (for instance, pre-emptive strikes against pirates rather than murdering spouses for insurance money).

The slaver benefited from the tutelage of cell mate and brilliant con artist Bernard "Legits" Ledger. Upon release five years later, Dal'serah incorporated Blue Suns as a legal security agency.

Today, the Blue Suns boast a galaxy-wide force of batarians, turians, humans, and krogan. Each deployment is backed by a logistics corps selling everything from heavy weapons to shaving cream. Despite claims that Blue Suns sells its captives as slaves, no Blue Suns employee has ever been convicted on such charges.

His notoriety ensured his initial public offering for investors made him rich beyond most krogan's dreams. Wrang returned triumphantly to his clan, rallying elders, krogan hordes, and their firepower and biotic support toward professional violence in the Terminus Systems.

Banned from Citadel space, the Blood Pack bribes its way through spaceports into armed conflicts across the galaxy.

The communications blackout followed an upgrade of the colony's small military force (supplemented by mechs and security drones) with high-powered, tower-mounted GARDIAN lasers. Colonists complained about construction cost overruns, delays, noise, and damage to the local environment. They also feared the defense array could be seen as provocative to their world's neighbors. Such fears may not have been baseless. Authorities have still offered no explanation for the communications blackout, fueling rumors of plagues, natural disasters, or a cult-inspired mass-suicide.

Thousands of years later, nature did what even the Protheans could not: a collision with another asteroid broke Omega in half, exposing its trove of element zero for easy mining.

A rush ensued as corporations and private individuals tried to strike it rich on Omega, and thieves and outlaws followed in their wake. As space became tight, construction of processing facilities extended vertically from the asteroid, creating Omega's jellyfish-like silhouette. To prevent future collisions, the station is ringed with enormous mass-effect field generators that redirect incoming debris.

Today, Omega is a major hub of narcotics, weapons, and eezo trafficking without even a pretense of civilian government or military control. Only mercenary groups have been able to instill a limited order; the most ruthless is an asari syndicate run by the notorious Aria T'Loak.

Theoretically, the geth could be preparing a devastating attack against which the Council could be defenseless, or the geth could have died out, so that the defense budget against them could be gaining the Alliance nothing but economic ruination.

Despite fears of geth, prospectors do occasionally mount salvage ventures inside the Veil; one ended in tragedy. Using technomental domination, the geth drew the team into the Veil before aiming them back as husks at the organic society that produced them.

Feros was considered a poor prospect for colonization, as little open ground remains for agriculture. The only sizable fresh water sources are the poles, which are tapped by the decaying Prothean aqueduct systems. The dead cities, while in good condition considering their antiquity, are of uncertain stability. Ground level is congested by a dozen meters of fallen debris, and the air is fouled by dust.

In 2178, the human ExoGeni Corporation announced its intention to place a permanent colony on Feros, to thoroughly explore the ruins.

As a scientific outpost of minimal military value, Haestrom was ill-equipped to repel geth forces during the insurrection and fell quickly under their control.

Captured geth planetary survey data indicates that despite sustaining damage, Haestrom's architecture remains as it was before the war, preserving a quarian architectural style that no longer exists anywhere else in the galaxy.

Because Haestrom's sun has overwhelmed the planet's protective magnetosphere, humans foolhardy enough to venture into geth-controlled Haestrom must exercise extreme caution. Minutes of radiation exposure will overload shields and hours of exposure will kill. Furthermore, solar output renders surface-to-orbit communication nearly impossible.</String>

Countless celebrities maintain palatial estates on Illium and in its capital, Nos Astra. The sole obstacle to business on Illium is its extensive bureaucracy, tolerated only for its provision of security.

Regardless of the character of its economy, Illium's self-congratulatory media exalts its own society with the provincial arrogance of "new money," glorifying in "sexiest CEOs" and "ten richest residents" lists.</String>

Ilos lies in a remote area of the Terminus Systems only accessible by the legendary Mu Relay. Four thousand years ago, the Mu Relay was knocked out of position by a supernova and lost. Since then, Ilos and its cluster have been inaccessible.

Occasionally, a university will organize an expedition to chart a route to Ilos using conventional FTL drive. These never get beyond the planning stages due to the distance and danger. The journey could take years or decades, passing through the hostile Terminus Systems and dozens of unexplored systems.</String>

Currently Korlus hosts numerous merc factions such as the Blue Suns, rumored to be using downed ship fossils to test advanced munitions. Massive gun batteries threaten anyone attempting planetfall, with minimal defenses against ground attack.

Because ancient vulcanism greenhoused the planet, Korlus was too hot and CO2-rich to develop a biosphere, despite the abundant lakes that could have sponsored the development of life.

Now cool enough for protected habitation, but too scorching for anyone but extremophiles and mercenaries seeking secrecy, Korlus supports numerous krogan outposts. The krogan have therefore seeded Korlus with hardy varren, often kept as war hounds. Varren live primarily on a diet of geophagous vermin and each other.</String>

A privately chartered colony world, the planet is owned by the Noveria Development Corporation holding company. The NDC is funded by investment capital from two dozen high technology development firms, and administrated by an Executive Board representing their interests.

The investors built remote hot labs in isolated locations across Noveria’s surface. These facilities are used for research too dangerous or controversial to be performed elsewhere, as Noveria is technically not part of Citadel space and therefore exempt from Council law. 

By special arrangement, Citadel Special Tactics and Reconnaissance agents have been granted extraterritorial privileges, but it remains to be seen how committed the Executive Board is to that principle. Given its unique situation, it is understandable that Noveria is often implicated in all manner of wild conspiracy theories.

Two centuries ago, batarian agribusiness chose uninhabited Pragia as their empire's breadbasket. Colonization authorities introduced nonnative, industrially mutated plants that flourished in the world's fertile volcanic soil. Synergizing with Pragia's natural geothermal conditions and chemotropic microbes, the imported species soon became a nightmare. Mutant strains of poisonous and even carnivorous plants arose, overgrowing colonies in days instead of years, and causing the batarians to abandon their holdings. Because the planet's small animal population is insufficient to check its plant growth, Alliance ecologists predict soil exhaustion in 400 years.

Due to its relative isolation and lack of population, Pragia has become a regional haven for drug-runners, weapons-smugglers, pirates, mercenaries, terrorists, and intelligence agents seeking secrecy.

But the drell took to industrialization early and did not realize the extent of the environmental damage they caused until it was too late. With their topsoil depleted and oceans too acidic to sustain life, the drell were situated for a massive population crash by 2025 CE.

It was then the hanar stepped in, mounting a large-scale rescue operation to bring drell to the hanar homeworld, Kahje. As wars erupted over what resources remained on Rakhana and billions began to die, approximately 375,000 drell escaped in the exodus. To repay their debt, the drell entered into an agreement with the hanar. Called the Compact, it states that the drell would assist the hanar with tasks the hanar cannot physically perform. Today, high-ranking hanar are often inseparable from their drell attendants.</String>

		<String id="719889">Virmire is a lush world located on the frontier of the Attican Traverse. Its vast seas and orbital position on the inner life zone have created a wide equatorial band of humid, tropical terrain. Only the political instability of the region has impeded efforts at colonization.

Many times, the Citadel has opened negotiations to settle Virmire with the various criminal gangs and petty dictatorships in the nearby Terminus Systems. All fell apart due to internal power shifts within the opposing parties. The Citadel has written off the colonization of Virmire as impossible without significant political change.

The Terminus powers themselves are unlikely to ever settle Virmire. Most lack the resources to support settlement of a virgin world, finding it more expedient to steal from their neighbors than build for themselves.</String>
		<String id="719890">Virmire</String>
		<String id="719891">The Terminus Systems are located on the far side of the Attican Traverse, beyond the space administered by the Citadel Council or claimed by the human Systems Alliance. It is populated by a loose affiliation of minor species, united only in their refusal to acknowledge the political authority of the Council or adhere to the Citadel Conventions.

Their independence comes at a price; the Terminus is fraught with conflict. War among the various species is common, as governments and dictators constantly rise and fall. The region is a haven for illegal activities, particularly piracy and the slave trade.

At least once a year, a fleet from Terminus invades the nearby Attican Traverse. These attacks are typically small raids against poorly defended colonies. The Council rarely retaliates, as sending patrols into the Terminus Systems could unify the disparate species against their common foe, triggering a long and costly war.

		<String id="719893">The flotilla, or the Migrant Fleet, is a fleet of roughly 50,000 starships that houses over 17 million quarians. The largest collection of starfaring vessels in the galaxy, the fleet is so large it may take days for all the ships to pass through a mass relay. 

The ships are constantly repaired, replaced, and upgraded to comfortably house as many quarians as possible. Typically, ships specialize in roles for the fleet, from the enormous agricultural liveships to the shielded lab ships to the repurposed freighters known as homeships that house quarian children, young parents, and educators. Employed quarians typically live in the ship they work on, since commuting from ship to ship ties up resources with unnecessary docking procedures.

Even within the flotilla, quarians on most ships will remain encased in their protective suits. Rarely, quarians will meet on "clean ships" for specific purposes such as medical services or reproduction. When this occurs, they remove their suits, knowing full well that it is likely they will spend a few days having allergic reactions or getting over infections as their weakened immune systems compensate for each other's presence.</String>

Nearly every gun on the battlefield is laden with features, from targeting auto-assists to projectile shavers that can generate thousands of rounds of ammunition from a small, internal block of metal.

It was long thought that personal weapons had plateaued in performance, but the geth proved all theories wrong. Mathematically reviewing their combat logs, the geth found that in an age of kinetic barriers, most firefights were won by the side who could put the most rounds down-range the fastest. But combatants were forced to deliberately shoot slower to manage waste heat, or pause as their weapons vented.

To eliminate this inefficiency, the geth adopted detachable heat sinks known as thermal clips. While organic arms manufacturers were initially doubtful this would produce a net gain, a well-trained soldier can eject and swap thermal clips in under a second. Faced with superior enemy firepower, organic armies soon followed the geth's lead, and today's battlefields are littered with these thermal clips.</String>
		<String id="719896">Small Arms</String>
		<String id="719897">Modern combat hardsuits have a "triple canopy" of protection: shields, armor, and self-repair. The outermost layer is created through kinetic barrier emitters, which detect objects incoming at a high rate of speed and generate deflecting "shields" provided they have enough energy in their power cells. 

If a bullet or other incoming object gets past the barrier, it contends with the more traditional body armor. A sealed suit of nonporous ballistic cloth provides kinetic and environmental protection, reinforced by lightweight composite ceramic plates in areas that either don't need to flex or require additional coverage, such as the chest and head. When the armor is hit by directed energy weapons, the plates boil away or ablate rather than burning the wearer.

The last level of protection is provided by the suit's microframe computers, whose input detectors are woven throughout the fabric. These manage the self-healing system, which finds rents in the fabric and, assuming any such tear would wound the flesh underneath, seals the area off with sterile, nonconductive medi-gel. This stanches minor wounds and plugs holes in the suit that could prove fatal in vacuum or toxic environments. Soldiers are not always fond of the "squish skin" that oozes gel on them at a moment's notice, but fatalities have dropped sharply since the system was implemented.</String>

Over 2,000 years ago, explorers foolishly opened a mass relay to a previously unknown system and encountered something never seen before or since: a species of spacefaring insects guided by a hive-mind intelligence.

Unfortunately, the rachni were not peaceful, and the galaxy was plunged into a series of conflicts known as the Rachni Wars. Attempts to negotiate were futile, as it was impossible to make contact with the hive queens that guided the race from beneath the surface of their toxic homeworld.

The emergence of the krogan ended the Rachni Wars. Bred to survive the harshest environments, the krogan were able to strike at the queens in their lairs and reclaim conquered Council worlds. But when krogan fleets pressed them back to their homeworld, the rachni refused to surrender, and the krogan eradicated them from the galaxy.</String>

		<String id="720124">Admiral Hackett dispatched marines to the planet Aratoht to rescue a deep cover agent, Dr. Amanda Kenson. The teams were killed in an explosion that wiped out both the colony and the system's relay. The Alliance spent weeks piecing together scattered radio transmissions, learning that the marines felt they had no choice but to send an asteroid into the relay to prevent invasion by the Reapers. While it bought the Alliance some time, the men and women lost on the mission were a severe blow to the 103rd Marine Corps.</String>

		<String id="720133">Some smugglers were surprisingly helpful to the Alliance by finding desperately needed military equipment.</String>
		<String id="720134">Spectre authorization released medical supplies from Customs to Huerta Memorial Hospital, improving the quality of patient care.</String>
		<String id="720135">A Spectre gave C-Sec permission to tap into surveillance on private citizens. C-Sec used the footage to make several arrests, improving security.</String>
		<String id="720136">C-Sec was authorized to train a civilian militia, strengthening their defense forces.</String>
		<String id="720137">C-Sec has been ignoring illegal sales of weapons to civilians. Some unlawful elements have taken advantage of this to build an arsenal, increasing the crime rate as they settle old scores.</String>
		<String id="720138">Housing was found for students from Grissom Academy too young to work on the Prothean device. These gifted teenagers have been helping, however, by dealing with any repetitive problems that can't be delegated to VIs.</String>
		<String id="720139">A pair of entrepreneurs was persuaded to switch from creating financial programs to advanced weapon-targeting VIs, and to sell them to the Alliance just above cost.</String>

		<String id="720208">Armor Bonus</String>
		<String id="720209">Shepard's current health bar will regenerate, but already-depleted segments can only be restored by using First Aid from the Power Wheel.</String>
		<String id="720210">Use the First Aid power to resuscitate a fallen squadmate from a distance. This consumes medi-gel. Move to your comrade to resuscitate them without using medi-gel.</String>
		<String id="720211">Squadmates do more damage when ordered to attack a specific target.</String>
		<String id="720212">Weapons have thermal clips to prevent overheating. Clips use a universal design, so retrieve compatible clips from combat areas and fallen enemies.</String>
		<String id="720213">Spent thermal clips are ejected to cool weapons. Run out of clips, and you can't fire.</String>
		<String id="720214">Headshots inflict superior damage on most targets.</String>
		<String id="720215">Weapons are more accurate when fired from cover.</String>
		<String id="720216">It's good practice to equip one slow, heavy weapon and one rapid-firing weapon to deal with different defenses.</String>
		<String id="720217">Carrying too many weapons will increase cooldown, effectively slowing down how often you can use powers.</String>
		<String id="720218">Powerful weapons recoil and are difficult to aim. Fire from cover and apply certain mods to steady your hand.</String>
		<String id="720219">Powerful weapons tend to have decreased thermal-clip capacities. Mod your weapon to improve its efficiency.</String>
		<String id="720220">The Widow, Black Widow, and Javelin weapons can fire through enemies and light cover. Mod other weapons, like the Mattock and Claymore, to apply this devastating effect.</String>
		<String id="720221">Shields and barriers protect against health damage. Shields appear as blue, and barriers are purple.</String>
		<String id="720222">Use rapid-fire weapons and Disruptor Ammo to bring down shields and barriers. Stop shields from regenerating by decimating them with Overload, Shield Drain, or Disruptor Ammo.</String>
		<String id="720223">Keep firing and unleashing powers to prevent enemy shields from regenerating.</String>
		<String id="720224">Use hard-hitting weapons against armored opponents. Incendiary and armor-piercing ammo also help.</String>
		<String id="720225">Certain biotic powers used in combination, like Warp and Throw, are highly effective against armored opponents.</String>
		<String id="720226">Cannibals form armored plating by reclaiming fallen Cannibals and Husks. Shooting these plates deals no damage to the Cannibal until they are blown off.</String>
		<String id="720227">Marauders buff Husks and Cannibals by giving them armored plating. Take out the Marauder first.</String>
		<String id="720228">When a Ravager's sac breaks, Swarmers are released. Swarmers are weak, but a group of them can kill or keep shields from regenerating.</String>
		<String id="720229">Don't let a Brute get close! Brutes are vicious opponents that can instantly kill you.</String>
		<String id="720230">Stop a Banshee when she becomes charged by damaging her while she uses biotic jumps to close in.</String>
		<String id="720231">Reaper troops protect themselves by deploying barrier generators called Barrier Engines. Target these first.</String>
		<String id="720232">Centurions deploy smoke screens to conceal their movement. See through this by equipping a sniper rifle with certain scope mods.</String>
		<String id="720233">Pick off engineers before they set up armored turrets or repair a damaged Atlas.</String>
		<String id="720234">Guardian shields block powers, shots, and melee. To kill a Guardian, stagger them with Throw or Concussive Shot or use Pull to tear away their shields. Flanking them also works.</String>
		<String id="720235">The Atlas is a hulking death machine with powerful armor, shields, and weapons. Shatter the canopy to expose the pilot.</String>
		<String id="720236">The Nemesis is a nimble opponent armed with a powerful sniper rifle. Take cover when you spot red laser sights honing in on your position.</String>
		<String id="720237">Destroy a Phantom's sword to remove its melee abilities. Phantoms are agile combatants, so keep pressure on them.</String>
		<String id="720238">Cerberus uses mobile defenses. Find and destroy the portable generators that power their shield pylons and cover nodes.</String>
		<String id="720239">Target Cerberus generators with Overload or Sabotage to cripple their defenses. If you take a Cerberus position, repair the shields to use them yourself.</String>
		<String id="720240">A cloaked Geth Hunter moves through the field virtually undetected, allowing them to flank with powerful plasma-shotguns. Take out their shields to disable their cloaking ability.</String>
		<String id="720241">Geth Pyros have flamethrowers that burn enemies at close range. Target their fuel tanks and use Overload and Sabotage.</String>
		<String id="720242">Geth Primes are command-and-control units that pulverize their enemies with pulse cannons, missile drones, and gun turrets.</String>
		<String id="720243">Geth rely heavily on their shields and are therefore vulnerable to Overload, Shield Drain, Sabotage, and Disruptor Ammo.</String>
		<String id="720244">Choosing the right squad to complement Shepard's strengths and weaknesses is key. Experiment with squad configurations.</String>
		<String id="720245">The last two power upgrades in a tree are passive skills that improve combat, weight capacity, and Paragon and Renegade bonuses.</String>

		<String id="720256">When subjected to an electrical current, the rare material dubbed element zero, or "eezo," emits a dark energy field that raises or lowers the mass of all objects within it. This "mass effect" is used in countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength construction materials. It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel.

Eezo is generated when solid matter, such as a planet, is affected by the energy of a star going supernova. The material is common in the asteroid debris that orbits neutron stars and pulsars. These are dangerous places to mine, requiring extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to survive the incredible radiation from the dead star. Only a few major corporations can afford the set-up costs required to work these primary sources.

Humanity discovered refined element zero at the Prothean research station on Mars, allowing them to create mass effect fields and develop FTL travel.</String>

Commander:
 
I don't know if you're aware how much you mean to people, but I am. The things I see in Battlespace's mailbox could make a geth grow tear ducts. Page after page of people asking you to go save their mother's planet, or the homeworld they outgrew, or the mining colony they sank their fortunes into. They don't know that you can't do it all. They just know Commander Shepard beat a Reaper once and can do it again.

I know how they feel. When I heard about Bekenstein, it was like all the nerves in my body were cut. But I need to believe that this isn't the end. I need to believe that you're going to destroy the Reapers and I'm going to film it as it happens. And when the fight is over, and my signal goes out on tightbeam, people are going to come together from all over the galaxy. They're going to watch from their couches, and they'll celebrate. And one day, they'll laugh again. 

The laughing part is important. I want you to make it all normal again, Shepard. Because that's the best revenge I can think of.

-- Diana

P.S. If I end up making it out of this but you don't, I'll make sure you get a hero's funeral and a Bekenstein wake. That's like an Irish wake, but not as sober and reserved.

		<String id="721294">Once believed to be of Prothean origin, mass relays were in fact created by the Reapers using technology far beyond that of other living species. The enormous structures, scattered throughout the stars, create corridors of virtually mass-free space. This allows instantaneous transit between locations normally separated by years or even centuries using conventional FTL drives.

Primary mass relays can propel ships thousands of light-years. The flight path, however, is fixed to a single relay elsewhere in the galaxy. By contrast, secondary relays, while only capable of propelling ships a few hundred light-years, can reach any other relay within their limited range.

Many primary relays lie dormant, their destinations not yet known. These relays are often left inactive on purpose, as established civilizations are unwilling to blindly open a passage that might connect them to a new, hostile species. The Reapers do not share the same concern, and freely use the dormant relays.</String>

The Alliance gained associate membership to the Citadel Council in 2165 and full membership in 2183, with Ambassador Donnel Udina representing humanity.

Human political-economic relationships vary between combative and lucrative. The turians who'd fought humans during the 2157 First Contact War have become valuable trade partners, despite residual social hostility. 

Other relationships are even more complicated. The rapid rise of human political influence on the Council--achieving in decades what others waited or are still waiting centuries to acquire--has galvanized suspicion and resentment against humanity. That negativity is vastly outweighed by the respect and trust humanity earned by saving the Council during the 2183 attack on the Citadel, at the cost of Alliance cruisers Cairo, Cape Town, Emden, Jakarta, Madrid, Seoul, Shenyang, and Warsaw and their 2400 crew.</String>

Many species regard humanity as a rogue race and its 2183 victory following the attack on Eden Prime as a brutal and calculated sacrifice of its military rivals. Humans allegedly leveraged military victory into a political one, carving associate membership out of the deaths of the Council.

Because of the human Spectre Shepard's pivotal role in defending the Citadel, many analysts conclude several humans will be made candidates for Spectre status, further solidifying the human contribution to galactic peace.

By achieving in decades what others waited centuries to receive, especially after so bloody a conflict, humans have guaranteed themselves deep hostility and fear throughout the galaxy.</String>

		<String id="722088">Humanity's first contact with an alien race occurred in 2157. At that time, the Alliance allowed survey fleets to activate any dormant mass relays discovered, a practice considered dangerous and irresponsible by Council-aligned races. When a turian patrol discovered a human fleet attempting to activate a relay, they attacked. One human vessel survived, retreating to the colony of Shanxi.

The turians followed, quickly defeating the local forces. Shanxi was occupied, the first--and, to date, only--human world to be conquered by an alien species. The turians believed the handful of ships they defeated represented the bulk of human defenses, so they were unprepared when the Second Fleet under Admiral Kastanie Drescher launched a strong counteroffensive, evicting them from Shanxi.

The turians mobilized for full-scale war, drawing the attention of the rest of the galaxy. The Council quickly intervened, forcing a truce. Fortunately for humanity, the First Contact War was ended with a diplomatic solution.</String>

		<String id="722090">Faster-than-light drives use element zero cores to reduce the mass of the ship, allowing higher rates of acceleration. This effectively raises the speed of light within the mass effect field, allowing high speed travel with negligible relativistic time dilation effects.

Starships still require conventional thrusters (chemical rockets, commercial fusion torch, economy ion engine, or military antiproton drive) in addition to the FTL drive core. With only a core, a ship has no motive power.

The amount of eezo and power required for a drive increases exponentially to the mass being moved and the degree it is being lightened. Very massive ships or very high speeds are prohibitively expensive.

If the field collapses while the ship is moving at faster-than-light speed, the effects are catastrophic. The ship is snapped back to sublight velocity, the enormous excess energy shed in the form of lethal Cerenkov radiation.</String>
		<String id="722091">FTL Drive</String>
		<String id="722092">Shells lofted by surface navies crash back to earth when their acceleration is overwhelmed by gravity and air resistance. In space, a projectile has unlimited range; it will keep moving until it hits something.

Practical gunnery range is determined by the velocity of the attacker's ordnance and the maneuverability of the target. Beyond a certain range, a small ship's ability to dodge trumps a larger attacker's projectile speed. The longest-ranged combat occurs between dreadnoughts, whose projectiles have the highest velocity but are the least maneuverable. The shortest-range combat is between frigates, which have the slowest projectile velocities and highest maneuverability.

Opposing dreadnoughts open with a main gun artillery duel at EXTREME ranges of tens of thousands of kilometers. The fleets close, maintaining evasive lateral motion while keeping their bow guns facing the enemy. Fighters are launched and attempt to close to disruptor torpedo range. Cautious admirals weaken the enemy with ranged fire and fighter strikes before committing to close action. Aggressive commanders advance so cruisers and frigates can engage.

At LONG range, the main guns of cruisers become useful. Friendly interceptors engage enemy fighters until the attackers enter the range of ship-based GARDIAN fire. Dreadnoughts fire from the rear, screened by smaller ships. Commanders must decide whether to commit to a general melee or retreat into FTL.

At MEDIUM range, ships can use broadside guns. Fleets intermingle, and it becomes difficult to retreat in order. Ships with damaged kinetic barriers are vulnerable to wolf pack frigate flotillas that speed through the battle space.

Only fighters and frigates enter CLOSE 'knife fight' ranges of 10 or fewer kilometers. Fighters loose their disruptor torpedoes, bringing down a ship's kinetic barriers and allowing it to be swarmed by frigates. GARDIAN lasers become viable weapons, swatting down fighters and boiling away warship armor.

Neither dreadnoughts nor cruisers can use their main guns at close range; laying the bow on a moving target becomes impossible. Superheated thruster exhaust becomes a hazard.</String>
		<String id="722093">Space Combat</String>
		<String id="722094">Larger warships are generally classified in one of four weights:

FRIGATES are small, fast ships used for scouting and screening larger vessels. Frigates often operate in wolf-pack flotillas. 

CRUISERS are middle-weight combatants, faster than dreadnoughts, and more heavily armed than frigates. Cruisers are the standard patrol unit, and often lead frigate flotillas.

DREADNOUGHTS are kilometer-long capital ships mounting heavy, long-range firepower. They are only deployed for the most vital missions. 

CARRIERS are dreadnought-sized vessels that also carry large numbers of fighters. 

Smaller vessels are almost exclusively used in a support role to the warships during combat:
 
FIGHTERS are one-man craft used to perform close-range attacks on enemy ships. 

INTERCEPTORS are one-man craft optimized for destroying opposing fighters.</String>

		<String id="722096">An artificial intelligence is a self-aware computing system capable of learning and independent decision making. Creation of a conscious AI requires adaptive code, a slow expensive education, and a specialized quantum computer called a "blue box."

An AI cannot be transmitted across a communication channel or computer network. Without its blue box, an AI is no more than data files. Loading these files into a new blue box will create a new personality, as variations in the quantum hardware and runtime results create unpredictable variations.

The geth serve as a cautionary tale against the dangers of rogue AI, and in Citadel Space they are technically illegal. Advocacy groups argue, however, that an AI is a living, conscious entity deserving the same rights as organics. They argue that continued use of the term "artificial" is institutionalized racism on the part of organic life; the term "synthetic" is considered the politically correct alternative.</String>

VIs use a variety of methods to simulate natural conversation, including an audio interface and an avatar personality to interact with. Although a VI can provide a convincing emulation of sentience, they are not self-aware, nor can they learn or take independent action.

VIs are used as operating systems on commercial and home computers. Minimal VI 'agents' are also available. Agents are compact and specialized. Some serve as personal secretaries, filtering calls and scheduling meetings based on user-defined priorities. Others are advanced search engines, propagating themselves across the extranet to collate user-requested data.

Commercial VIs in a variety of stock personalities are available at any software retailer. Boutique firms and hobbyists also build unique VIs to personal specification. Although software emulation of living personalities is illegal, reconstructions of famous historical figures are common.</String>

		<String id="722100">Kinetic barriers, commonly called shields, provide protection against most mass accelerator weapons. Whether on a starship or a soldier's suit of armor, the basic principle remains the same.

Kinetic barriers are repulsive mass effect fields projected from tiny emitters. These shields safely deflect small objects traveling at rapid velocities. This affords protection from bullets and other dangerous projectiles, but still allows the user to sit down without knocking away their chair. 

The shielding afforded by kinetic barriers does not protect against extremes of temperature, toxins, or radiation.</String>

		<String id="722102">A mass accelerator propels a solid metal slug using precisely controlled electromagnetic attraction and repulsion. The slug is designed to squash or shatter on impact, increasing the energy it transfers to the target. If this were not the case, it would simply punch a hole right through, doing minimal damage.

Accelerator design was revolutionized by element zero. A slug lightened by a mass effect field can be accelerated to greater speeds, permitting projectile velocities that were previously unattainable. If accelerated to a high enough velocity, a simple paint chip can impact with the same destructive force as a nuclear weapon.

However, mass accelerators produce recoil equal to their impact energy. This is mitigated somewhat by the mass effect fields that rounds are suspended within, but weapon recoil is still the prime limiting factor on slug velocity.</String>

At first glance, it appears this territory encompasses most of the galaxy. In reality, however, less than 1% of the stars have been explored.

Even mass-effect-FTL drive is slow relative to the volume of the galaxy. Empty space and systems without suitable drive discharge sites are barriers to exploration. Only the mass relays allow ships to jump hundreds of light-years in an instant, the key to expanding across an otherwise impassable galaxy.

Whenever a new relay is activated, the destination system is rapidly developed. From that hub, FTL drive is used to expand to nearby star clusters. The result is a number of densely developed clusters thinly spread across the vast expanse of space, connected by the mass relay network.</String>

		<String id="722107">The Council is an executive committee composed of representatives from the Asari Republics, the Turian Hierarchy, and the Salarian Union. Though they have no official power over the independent governments of other species, the Council's decisions carry great weight throughout the galaxy. No single Council race is strong enough to defy the other two, and all have a vested interest in compromise and cooperation.

Each of the Council species has general characteristics associated with the various aspects of governing the galaxy. The asari are typically seen as diplomats and mediators. The salarians gather intelligence and information. The turians provide the bulk of the military and peacekeeping forces.

Any species granted an embassy on the Citadel is considered an associate member, bound by the accords of the Citadel Conventions.

		<String id="722293">The HUD, short for Heads-Up Display, is the collection of icons and status bars you see on the edges of the screen as you play the game. In Mass Effect 3, there are five HUDs to keep an eye on:

1. Shield Bar
2. Health Bar
3. Power Cooldown Indicator
4. Ammo Indicator
5. Squadmate Status</String>
		<String id="722294">Monitor your shield level by checking the blue bar on the bottom of the screen. When this bar is full, shields prevent the brunt of an attack from affecting your health. As attacks are absorbed by the shield, it is reduced in strength. When the shield bar is depleted, incoming attacks affect your health bar instead.

Shields take several seconds to recharge and regenerate. Any damage taken during this recharge period stops the process. A shattered shield takes longer to regenerate than a partially depleted shield.</String>
		<String id="722295">Health is represented by the red bar broken into five segments that's tucked underneath the blue shield bar on the bottom of the screen. 

When you are attacked while the shield bar is depleted, the rightmost red segment of the health bar starts turning gray. Only First Aid can regenerate a fully depleted bar of health. A health segment that is only partially reduced will regenerate on its own if you can get to cover and avoid further damage.

You die if you lose all five health segments!</String>
		<String id="722296">Some powers require energy to use. The time it takes before you can use a power again is called cooldown. Cooldown periods vary, depending on the power.

When cooldown is in effect, two red semicircles appear on either side of the targeting reticle at the center of the screen. Cooldown time can be judged by the distance between the two semicircles. When these come together and merge, cooldown is complete, and you can use powers again.</String>
		<String id="722297">Weapons use heat-sink technology to enable rapid, devastating firepower. When a clip's worth of heat accumulates in the sink, it is ejected from the weapon. Running out of heat sinks is effectively the same as running out of ammo. 

Keep track of your heat-sink inventory on the bottom-left of the screen. The bottom number indicates how many shots the current heat sink has left, and the top number shows you the total number of shots the entire inventory of heat sinks has left. When a weapon runs out of sinks, "No Ammo" will display just below the targeting reticle, and you'll have to find new cylinders for the weapon or switch to an already-loaded weapon.</String>
		<String id="722298">There are two portraits of Shepard's current squadmates below the shield bar on the bottom of the screen. The icon beside each portrait shows the last power the squadmate used and its current cooldown status. 

A squadmate's portrait flashes red when they take damage, and if they become incapacitated, the portrait fades to gray.</String>

		<String id="722435">From: Alliance News Network Information Partners

By Ruxius Rilius, ANN contributor 

Citadel - Where is the quarian fleet? The latest intelligence shows that the Reapers are taking system after system at a feverish pace. Members of all races are fleeing their stations, colonies, and in some cases, their homeworlds. 

This kind of forced exodus might seem especially familiar to the nomadic quarians, who were pushed off their homeworld by the synthetic geth centuries ago. But as the galaxy pushes back against the Reapers, the quarians are conspicuously absent.

Turian and Alliance spokespeople cannot provide the fleet's current location. They say they have other concerns at the moment. 

Whatever the quarians are up to, they want it kept secret from the Council. After a refueling stop at Illium, the fleet left no stated destination. And there are also reports of a galaxy-wide call for all young adult quarians to abandon their Pilgrimages to rejoin the fleet.

Greedy and shortsighted powers will always try to gain the upper hand in times of galactic crisis. We can only hope that whatever the quarians are planning does not interfere with the only thing that should matter: stopping the Reapers.

Data suggests the quarian fleet is withdrawing its pilgrims and upgrading ships for combat somewhere near the Perseus Veil.
