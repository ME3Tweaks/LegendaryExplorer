It's been a while. I'm glad to hear you made it off Earth and that Liara's with you. Getting off her old ship was the best thing we could've done. Can't tell you how sick I was of that cabin. And of tripping over that drone. I don't even know how it kept finding me in a ship that big, even after I turned off its tracking. 

I dug up some interesting information for you. Talk with Glyph to sort out the data. I hope it helps, Shepard. It's getting rough out there.

		<String id="722553">Assistance Request from Admiral Xen</String>
		<String id="722554">Admiral Xen has requested leave to perform additional experiments involving attacks on synthetic intelligences. While the experiments are purely theoretical, the nature of the experiments includes creating suicidal semi-AIs that infect other AIs and then self-terminate, which raises possible legal and ethical concerns. Xen has promised that this will improve defenses against Reaper attacks.

He maintains that he joined Cerberus purely in an effort to save endangered colonists and that he does not pose a security threat.

		<String id="722561">I made contact with Tazzik yesterday. The look on his face was priceless. He's not happy you put me in charge of scouting the Terminus Systems, but he's doing a good job of keeping us alive. I've never seen so many pirates and mercs on edge. The black market's unreliable, and it's getting harder to make contact with suppliers. The Alliance won't be able to rely on it as a source of Crucible materials for long if things get worse. Some of the other operatives think we should cut our losses now, but I just keep asking them, "When did the odds ever stop the Broker?"

Feron

PS: I hope you finally got our little friend Droney to stop saying "Shadow" and "Broker" out loud in the same sentence to anyone in sight.</String>

		<String id="722740">Kinect Controls</String>
		<String id="722741">In Mass Effect 3, you can use Kinect's voice recognition to talk with characters, explore areas, and issue orders to squadmates. Kinect responds to different voice commands and phrases depending on the context. This section will help you get the most out of the experience. 

Before you play, select (Kinect Tuner) from the main menu to ensure your Kinect is working properly.</String>
		<String id="722742">Exploration</String>
		<String id="722743">Exploration commands are used to interact with in-game objects like doors and items. The appropriate command will display when you approach an object or person. When the gray command text turns white, you can say the command aloud. If the correct command is heard, the microphone icon will flash green. If Kinect does not understand, it will flash red.

Verbal commands during exploration include: Use, Open, Bypass, Activate, Deactivate, and Reactivate, as well as Support, Pick Up, Examine, Warn, Salvage, and Talk.

When not in combat, conversations, or cutscenes, you can save the game by saying: "Quick Save."</String>
		<String id="722744">Conversations</String>
		<String id="722745">When speaking with characters, a microphone icon will appear in the middle of the conversation hub, indicating your opportunity to verbally reply. Read out the response you'd like to give, and Kinect will select it automatically.</String>
		<String id="722746">Combat: Controlling Shepard</String>
		<String id="722747">In combat, you can use any of Shepard's powers by saying them aloud. As an adept, for instance, say "Warp" during combat to use the power. You'll know the command has registered when the microphone icon in the top left corner of the screen turns blue. 

In addition to powers, Kinect works with items like First Aid and grenades. To use the item, say: "First Aid" or "Grenade." 

You can also switch weapons by saying "Switch Weapon," "Swap Weapon," or by saying the weapon type. 

Kinect understands the following weapon types: 
- Heavy Pistol
- Submachine Gun
- Assault Rifle
- Shotgun
- Sniper Rifle
- Grenade

To use a grenade, you can also say: "Throw Grenade." For a complete list of commands to activate Shepard's powers, see the Combat: Power Commands section.</String>
		<String id="722748">Combat: Commanding Squadmates</String>
		<String id="722749">Squadmates will take verbal orders from you in combat. To issue an order to a squadmate, say: (squadmate)+(order).

You can order a squadmate, like James, to follow you by saying: "James: Follow Me." The same works for "Attack" and "Move." Saying "James: Attack" will order James or any other squadmate you specify to attack the target currently in front of you. If you say "James: Move," James will move to the spot you are currently targeting. 

If you don't specify a squadmate, and just say: "Attack," "Move," or "Follow Me," both squadmates will carry out the order. The same works for "Cover Me."

You can also order squadmates to switch and swap weapons, as well as use grenades. To do this, specify which squadmate you wish to carry out the order, followed by the order. For example, "James: Switch Weapon" will tell James to switch his weapon. "James: Pistol" will tell James to switch to his pistol specifically. "James: Throw Grenade" will tell James to use a grenade. 

To help a fallen squadmate up, approach them and say: "Revive."</String>
		<String id="722750">Combat: Power Commands</String>
		<String id="722751">Shepard will use the following powers if you say them aloud to Kinect during combat, provided they are known. To see the available powers for Shepard at any given time, consult the Power Wheel by pressing and holding [XBoxB_Btn_RB].

Adept
Cluster Grenade, Pull, Shockwave, Singularity, Throw, Warp

Soldier
Adrenaline Rush, Concussive Shot, Incendiary Ammo, Disruptor Ammo, Cryo Ammo, Frag Grenade

Vanguard	
Biotic Charge, Nova, Incendiary Ammo, Cryo Ammo, Pull, Shockwave</String>
		<String id="722752">Combat: Squadmate Powers</String>
		<String id="722753">You can order a specific squadmate to use an available power by saying their name followed by the name of the power you want them to use, i.e.: "James Carnage."

For a list of available powers for each squadmate, consult the Power Wheel by pressing and holding [XBoxB_Btn_RB].

If a squadmate has the power that you say aloud, he or she will use that power before Shepard, even if you don't say his or her name. The exception to this is ammo powers like Cryo and Incendiary. With these, you must specify the squadmate, or only Shepard will use them.</String>
		<String id="722754">Regional Accent Settings</String>
		<String id="722755">English speakers can choose between the following three regions based on their accent to help Kinect better recognize their commands.

- North America
- United Kingdom
- Australia/New Zealand

For all the geth resources we found on Rannoch, we still don't have the technology it will take to hold off the Reapers, but what we found did give me ideas for experiments that could help halt the Reaper advance. You're a Spectre. Use your authorization to get me the tools I need to complete these experiments... before it's too late.</String>

I've called and I've sent messages, but gotten no response. With Earth's comm system out, I don't expect this will get through, either, but I heard a rumor the Normandy docked here at the Citadel.

Are you alive? I'm at Huerta Memorial Hospital under the name Tannor Nuara. Please excuse the moniker and this email's encryption--in my line of work, it is unwise to advertise my location, particularly when I am not in good health.

We should meet before circumstances force us apart again.

This may be a dumb idea, but... I heard you were having some trouble sleeping. Don't freak out! Word gets around. Anyway, I was thinking it would be nice for us to get together, just the two of us. Find a quiet spot on the Citadel, or try to at least. We could both probably use the downtime.

		<String id="723417">Each theater of war has one of four alerts, known as readiness ratings. Use these ratings to evaluate which theater most needs your team's help in countering the Reaper invasion.

Red = Critical: Immediate action required to counter the Reaper invasion.

Orange = Urgent: Action required to counter the Reaper threat.

Yellow = Serious: Help needed, but current forces are holding the Reapers off.

Green = Stable but at Risk: Battle lines are holding.

The more waves completed in a mission, the more you improve the readiness ratings of these war fronts. Often, a squad must run multiple countermissions to improve a theater's invasion status. Neglect a green or yellow theater for too long, and the Reapers will start taking it back.</String>

		<String id="723421">Each theater of war has one or more conflict zones, which are also known as firebases.

To defend a theater, you must choose a corresponding firebase when joining or creating a match. Do this by changing the mission's location.

Setting the location to "unknown" will give each player's character an experience bonus of +10% and will improve the readiness rating of all theaters by up to +5%. Choosing a specific firebase improves the readiness rating of its theater by +15% and improves the rating of all other theaters by +2%.</String>
		<String id="723422">Invading forces are made up of Reapers, Cerberus, and Geth.

If you wish to defend a territory against a specific hostile force, choose an enemy type when joining or creating a mission.

Setting the enemy to "unknown" generates an enemy at random and awards your character a +15% experience bonus.</String>
		<String id="723423">Choose from bronze, silver, and gold challenges when joining or creating a mission.

Bronze challenges are intended for beginners, silver for intermediate players, and gold is for experts. The harder the difficulty setting, the more credits and experience your character earns.</String>

Shepard: As promised, here is what we have on Kai Leng.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
From: Alliance Records &lt;xxxxxx@xxxxx.xxx.xx&gt;
Subject: Kai Leng's Dossier
To: Steven Hackett &lt;xxxxxxxx@xxxxx.xxx.xx&gt;

Name: Leng, Kai
Date of Systems Alliance Military Enlistment: November 14, 2172. 
Age on Enlistment: 16 [credentials faked]

Tours of Duty:
2172 - Terminus Systems. Patrol and reconnaissance.
2173 - Exodus Cluster. Patrol and reconnaissance. (Reprimanded for taking medals from dead enemy officers; sentence reduced in light of previous, exemplary service record)
2174 - Raid of Entiyon. (Recommended for Systems Alliance Medal of Valor)
2175 - Kite's Nest. Tactical reconnaissance. (Accepted into Interplanetary Combatives Academy)
2176 - Received N7 designation from Interplanetary Combatives Academy.

Cerberus Activities:
Intel on Kai Leng's activities after joining Cerberus is spotty. What is known is that the Illusive Man arranged for Leng's escape from prison, employing him as an operative for the next ten years. Leng is now believed to be the Illusive Man's most trusted agent, working as an infiltrator and assassin. His cybernetic modifications appear to include Cerberus's Phantom-class implants.</String>

Commander, 

Cerberus has attacked Eden Prime and is now occupying the colony. Alliance forces are stretched too thin right now to attempt to liberate the colony, but we've been doing what we can to covertly aid the local resistance. 

In the process, we've learned that Cerberus has uncovered a major Prothean artifact. We don't know what it is, but it appears to be the reason for the attack on the colony. We need you to infiltrate the colony and recover the artifact.</String>

		<String id="724250">From: Alliance News Network Information Partners

Alliance officials confirm a local resistance movement has successfully pushed Cerberus forces off Eden Prime. 

Cerberus attacked Eden Prime for reasons that remain unclear and set up facilities to occupy the colony. But after constant attacks from a united populace, Cerberus troops retreated. Alliance officials are sending in evacuation transports now to get colonists off-world before Reaper forces reach the colony.

"We owe this victory to the Alliance," resistance leader Edward Crabb said in a prepared statement. "The people of Eden Prime have always been ready to fight, but Alliance intel gave us the tools we needed to push those Cerberus bastards off our planet." 

Many resistance fighters have said they plan to enlist to support the Alliance.</String>

Local resistance is heavy in the south and west sections of the colony. We've pulled most of our troops from the north neighborhoods to assist. All remaining troops in the north neighborhood: continue standard patrol activities to maintain the illusion of a large presence in that area. If the locals knew we were understaffed, they could do some serious damage.</String>
		<String id="724285">Quick-Kill Cerberus Trooper</String>
		<String id="724286">Resistance Information Update

We've gotten word from our source within Eden Prime's resistance movement that we can expect an attack on our security center between 2200 and 2300 tomorrow night. They're pulling in forces from across the colony--this gives us the perfect chance to destroy their leadership.

Once the attack is contained, allow Dr. William Cambiata to escape, firing near-miss shots to keep it realistic. He's given us good information, and with luck, the locals will see him as a daring hero and the only man to escape the Cerberus trap. They might even put him in charge!</String>
		<String id="724287">Processing Update

We've taken more able-bodied men and women from pacified neighborhoods. The colonists generally have accepted the story that they have gone to perform tedious but safe manual labor in a Cerberus research camp on the other side of the planet, and when we increased food rations as "payment for the work," most of the complaints died out.

Maintain the story as long as possible. We don't have the manpower to fight the entire colony, and if these families knew they were never going to see their sons and daughters again, there's no way they'd cooperate.</String>

		<String id="724439">Interplanetary Combatives Training (ICT) is the Systems Alliance's premier school for leadership and combat expertise. The Interplanetary Combatives Academy, sometimes called "N-School" or "the villa," recruits officers from every branch of Earth's militaries to partake in grueling courses at Vila Militar in Rio de Janeiro.

Initially, candidates train for more than 20 hours per day, leading small combat teams through hostile terrain with little sleep or food. Trainees who do well are awarded an internal designation of N1 and are invited to return. Subsequent courses--N2 through N6--are often held off-planet and include instruction in zero-G combat, military free-fall (parachuting), jetpack flight, combat diving, combat instruction, linguistics, and frontline trauma care for human and alien biology.

The highest grade of training, N6, provides actual combat experience in conflict zones throughout the galaxy. If the trainee survives these scenarios in "admirable and effective fashion," he or she finally receives the coveted N7 designation. N7 is the only ICT designation that may be worn on field or dress uniforms. 

There is little shame in failing an N course--the training is so extreme that even qualifying for N1 elevates an officer to a position of respect. The universal prestige of merely attending the academy helps to restrain trainees from taking excessive risks in pursuit of higher honors.

Although ICT qualification by itself does not guarantee higher rank, those officers who are able to complete the program are typically well suited to senior leadership positions.</String>

While we were in dry dock, Joker suggested that a small welcoming gift would be appropriate to have on hand, should you be reinstated as commanding officer. As the ship does not have the capacity to accommodate the dancers he suggested, I chose something from the official Systems Alliance catalog. Soldiers who have held an N7 designation for five years or more are entitled to a commemorative hooded jacket for wear on off-duty hours. You will find it among the selection of casual clothing in your cabin.

		<String id="724785">Power combos require a source power and a detonator power. Source powers generally leave a lasting effect on an enemy (Pull, Cryo Blast, Reave, etc.). Detonator powers generally deal high damage or force (Carnage, Incinerate, Warp, etc.). Most powers can be a source, a detonator, or both, so explore the many combinations.

Power combos come in four types:

Biotic Combos: Trigger these by combining more than one biotic effect, such as lifting an enemy with Pull before striking them with Warp. Biotic combos result in an explosion that blasts not just the target, but also the area around the target.

Electric Combos: Trigger these by combining an electrical effect with a detonator, such as electrocuting an enemy with Overload before striking them with Concussive Shot. Electric combos result in bonus damage to shields and a chance to stun undefended enemies.

Flame Combos: Trigger these by combining a flame effect with a lethal detonator, such as igniting an enemy with Incinerate before finishing them off with Carnage. Flame combos result in bonus damage to armor and a chance to light undefended enemies on fire.

Cryo Combos: Trigger these by combining a freeze effect with a lethal detonator, such as freezing an enemy with Cryo Ammo before finishing them off with Biotic Charge. Cryo combos freeze undefended enemies and will chill the rest.</String>

		<String id="727390">War Assets

The people, weapons, armies, and fleets that you've accumulated are your war assets. The overall readiness of the galaxy determines how effectively these assets will perform in the final battle.</String>
		<String id="727391">Theaters of War

Each conflict zone has a readiness rating that reflects its ability to contribute to the final battle. Left unattended, these zones can deteriorate and reduce the overall readiness rating.</String>
		<String id="727392">Search and Rescue

The Normandy is equipped with a new and improved scanning pulse that can detect objects of interest. Use this to uncover war assets, artifacts, intel, and fuel as you fly around a system.

Be aware, however, that each time the pulse is used, the chance that Reapers will enter the system to investigate is increased.

If a Reaper enters the system you are in, flee and wait until you have completed a mission before returning.

		<String id="727393">Conquered Systems

Clusters already conquered by the Reapers can be accessed using the Normandy's stealth drive. Search these clusters for survivors, salvage, and valuable intel.
