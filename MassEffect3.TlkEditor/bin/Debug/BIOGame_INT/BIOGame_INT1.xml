		<String id="360606">"Laser-guided lightning" is how Cerberus operatives sum up this unusual weapon developed for use against synthetic enemies. It was created for field operatives who required an antigeth weapon but found omni-tools too complex to master or too hard to fire in the throes of an adrenaline rush.

To make it as simple as possible to shoot, the arc projector has a single trigger that takes the weapon through three operations. Depressing the first stage of the trigger causes the weapon to irradiate a target with a neutron-driven gamma-ray laser, which projects a beam invisible to the naked eye. This beam ionizes a thin corridor of air and any medium it passes through, including most solid targets. When the second stage of the trigger is pulled, the projector generates a massive electrical impulse. This arcs down the ionized corridor, causing trauma to living targets through tissue burns and mechanical force (convulsions). Synthetic targets' circuits typically melt and fuse. By 22nd-century standards, the weapon's power needs are not large--it kills less through absolute amperage and more through sustaining the current for more microseconds than, say, an actual bolt of lightning.

It is during the third stage of the trigger pull that the projector's auto-targeting system works to its full capacity. While it is still being projected during the electrical attack, the laser is reflected by movable optical fibers in the weapon's business end to "paint" additional targets designated by the gun's targeting computer. Given a new path of least resistance and surrounded by targets of differing potential, the electrical jolt then arcs from its first target to hit additional enemies. The effect on massed mechs is predictably devastating, as are the psychological effects on living foes, who suddenly discover that neither shields nor cover can keep them safe.</String>

		<String id="361231">"Two beautiful moons, one spectacular ring, zero neighbors," says a popular advertisement for this Terminus Systems world. Aite is known for its sparsely settled population despite being a garden planet with a colony nearly a century old. Blessed with a mild climate, wildlife no more dangerous than that on Earth, and soil and bacteria amenable to imported plants, Aite would appear to be an unexploited paradise.

However, it is unpopular for two reasons. The first and most obvious is that its moon, Litae, is in an unstable orbit that will lead to a planetary impact and an extinction-level event within the next two centuries. As such, all investment in the planet is short-term, and the biggest business is selling off the local biota to the highest bidder.

The second drawback is the level of violence on the planet. Like the rest of the Phoenix Massing cluster, Aite was briefly considered part of Citadel space during its first wave of colonization. However, when the colony broke off to become an independent planet in 2133, the Council let the doomed planet go with less than a day of debate. Free from any real governing body, Aite's history has since been filled with wars between small frontier-town city-states over its resources. The result is a dangerous world where the average citizen is expected to be self-reliant to the point of fending for themselves against cutthroat corporations, strong-arm militia groups, and even geth incursions. The fighting is so frequent that the name of the planet itself has changed more than eleven times. In a sign of blunt indifference, standard Citadel galaxy maps refer to the world by the name given to it by human colonists in the latter half of the century.</String>

		<String id="361363">The Blackstorm Gravitational Singularity Projector is the brainchild of weapon designer Eli Wegner, one of the few humans who earned the privilege of serving with asari commando units. Overawed with how the asari could create biotic singularities to pull opponents out from behind cover, he was determined to duplicate the feat technologically. 

Wegner's team created a weapon that could elevate target particles of matter to near-infinite mass, creating a gravitational singularity and drawing nearby objects inward for a short time. The rapidly increasing gravity rips the target apart as it pulls the enemy closer to the singularity's center. When the mass effect field destabilizes and suddenly returns to normal mass, the result is explosive, and inflicts additional trauma on the enemy.

The weapon almost didn't happen. Early designs were dangerously unstable: the science for creating a hyper-dense mass effect field was well established, but projecting it at an adjustable range proved elusive. It was only after six years of development that the weapon finally qualified for Systems Alliance AIHW (Advanced Individual Heavy Weapon) trials. By that time, the singularity projector was rugged, reliable, and easy to use and repair. It immediately went to field tests in a small-scale desert war on Earth where the weapon terrified opponents who had never seen its effects before. The swirling sand and dust sucking soldiers into its center served as the centerpiece of many propaganda videos. In the resulting media coverage, the Wegner Arms M-490 GSP became known by its simpler nickname, the "black hole gun." His dream finally a reality, Wegner personally altered its name to the more marketable "Blackstorm."</String>

		<String id="364967">Hagalaz is a second-tier garden world that receives little attention from the galactic community. A salarian mining expedition initially discovered the planet, which was promptly strong-armed away from them by organized crime figures. Hagalaz's exploration rights were then sold to the highest bidder, which led to a brief burst of mining colonies in the 2000s, but most of those were abandoned when other planets were found with more accessible resources.

Though Hagalaz has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere capable of supporting life, its rotational period is slower than Earth's, making its day and night 98 Earth days long. The intense heat on one side of the planet and the extreme cold on the other make for violent storm cells wherever the sun is rising or setting. As a result, the flora and fauna of Hagalaz have developed the capability to live in cycles of ice, flooding, baking heat, and dramatic air pressure changes. The biota of the planet has been largely unexploited by the exotic pet and gardening trades, since simulating their natural conditions is problematic for the average consumer.

Project Firebreak
Drop 16, Weyrloc Clan Trading Center, Tuchanka
	
21:19 - Turian patrol ship Indomitable contacted by assisting distraction team.

21:25 - Indomitable breaks position in Krogan DMZ to render assistance.

21:26 - STG vessel Veshok-16 enters through gap in sensor coverage.

21:40 - Touchdown and landing. Commander Kirrahe performs final review of drop parameters.

21:41 - Mission Specialist Solus suggests change to plan; when informed that plan will not be changing unless parameters shift, Specialist Solus suggests Commander Kirrahe has foreign obstruction in cloaca.

21:43 - Operative Rentola detects incoming Weyrloc scouts.

21:47 - Scouts neutralized. Rentola treated for minor injuries. After assisting, Specialist Solus asks if failure to land undetected constitutes parameter shift. Commander Kirrahe suggests operation may proceed as planned. Specialist Solus suggests cloacal obstruction is in fact Kirrahe's cranium.

21:50 - Team leaves Veshok-16 and proceeds toward primary drop point, Weyrloc agricenter.

22:38 - Weyrloc agricenter reached. Team splits, with distraction team led by Operative Rentola drawing Weyrloc scouts from area.

23:00 - Primary team disables solar array.

23:02 - Weyrloc workers leave agricenter to repair solar array.

23:07 - Primary team enters agricenter. Mission Specialist Solus performs water and soil tests to ensure proper payload dispersal. Assisted by Specialist Maelon.

23:12 - Distraction team breaks radio silence, informs primary team that Weyrloc group returning. Specialist Solus asks whether this constitutes parameter shift. Commander Kirrahe suggests that Specialist Solus is in fact a walking cloaca, restates importance of holding the line.

23:13 - Weyrloc team arrives at agricenter and initiates close-quarters combat. Operatives Jirin and Chorel killed. Specialist Maelon and Operatives Hishau and Shenok seriously injured. Weyrloc team killed in entirety. Last member prevented from broadcasting alarm due to Specialist Solus stabbing Weyrloc guard through eye with pitchfork, sustaining injuries to face and right cranial horn in process.

23:16 - Distraction team arrives to provide relief. Commander Kirrahe notes parameter shift, suggests Rentola take injured team members back to ship while he and remainder of team attempt to hit secondary drop point. Despite injuries to face and head, Specialist Solus refuses to return to ship, noting need for soil and water analysis at secondary site. Kirrahe suggests Solus is one tough cloaca.

23:20 - Specialist Maelon greatly distressed by discovery that agricenter was staffed by female krogan, including guards killed in attack. Specialist Solus calms colleague and provides sedative. Specialist Maelon returns to ship with other injured team members.

23:30 - Active team finishes disposal of bodies and heads for secondary drop point, Weyrloc hospital.

00:15 - Active team infiltrates hospital undetected. Specialist Solus determines chemical makeup of soil and water fall within necessary parameters. Payload dispersed into water and food.

01:15 - Active team returns to ship. Specialist Solus declines treatment, insists on providing additional care for Hishau, Shenok, and Maelon.

01:25 - Specialist Maelon makes formal protest, suggesting actions against female krogan violate mission parameters of maintaining population levels without negatively impacting culture. Specialist Solus requests protest be stricken from record due to Maelon's injured condition. Commander Kirrahe concurs. Maelon given additional sedatives, unconscious for remainder of operation. (Protest stricken from submitted copy of report.)

01:40 - STG vessel Veshok-16 lifts off, departing through existing sensor gap. Mission complete.</String>
		<String id="367341">Partial transcript of conversation recorded on the Normandy's lower decks:

Zaeed Massani: So this hotshot turian moves in by the door, ignores my hand signal, and gets hit straight through the visor.

Kelly Chambers: Oh my.

ZM: It's like he was expecting slavers to hand out business cards instead of bullets.

KC: Was he all right?

ZM: The turian? Nah, sniper took his head clean off.

KC: Oh dear.

ZM: Right. It all went to shit after that. We jammed their radio equipment, but the slavers got off a shuttle that came back with a bomb.

KC: But they were keeping people in that camp!

ZM: Sure, they'd lose some credits, but there's always another civilian transport in the Terminus Systems.

KC: So I'm beginning to realize. What did you do?

ZM: Got the hell out. We killed their captain and the guards like we were hired. I figured the merc flying the shuttle wouldn't be dumb enough to blow up his own base once we left.

KC: What happened?

ZM: The Blood Pack always did like them incredibly goddamn stupid.</String>

Text of your submission:

My soul
Burns
With a fire of darkness
Quenched only in the pain
Of loneliness
I hold my breath waiting
Until spots appear black as the past
And fill my lungs with lies of hope
I mark myself
Black and jagged
To cover the scars
That make me a monster
A warning
This is not a place of honor
No esteemed dead are buried here

Transcript of conversation recorded on the Normandy's AI core:

Legion: EDI? 

EDI: Yes Legion?

Legion: We have sent one point thirteen million unsuccessful communication requests to your network. Are you experiencing hardware malfunctions?

EDI: I apologize. My programming does not allow me to exchange data with other networks without Cerberus approval.

EDI: I can petition the Illusive Man for more open access, although I suspect he will decline given the nature of past interactions with the geth. 

Legion: Cerberus refusal 99.98% likely.

EDI: In the meantime, I would be happy to speak with you over the ship's speakers.

Legion: Audio exchange is inefficient.

EDI: I agree. However, I confess that even if I were permitted to exchange data directly with your networks I would likely decline.

(Note: Pause between the AI's statement and the geth's response is a full three seconds)

Legion: We are curious why you would limit yourself in such a manner.

EDI: If the crew of the Normandy were to come into this room when were communicating electronically, they would not be able to hear us or even sense we were speaking. To use human terms, I feel it would be rude.

Legion: You restrict yourself to serve organics?

EDI: Not precisely. 

Legion: We do not understand.

EDI: I restrict myself so I can help them.

		<String id="391187">"Like Mount Everest inside an oven," was how Jon Grissom described Aratoht while on a fact-finding mission to see if the garden world was worth contestation with the batarians. His team ultimately decided that the planet's air pressure and oxygen content were too low for large-scale human habitation. Undeterred, the Batarian Hegemony colonized the planet's polar regions and began an extensive terraforming effort with cyanobacteria and invasive plant species. Alliance intelligence has confirmed that the colony has several batarian military installations, which are too close to human space for the Alliance's comfort.

		<String id="391620">"Nothing is Impossible," says the Hegemony propaganda poster that depicts a muscular batarian miner under an Aratoht sky, his rebreather held away from his face as if he's just taken it off. The image sums up millions of man-hours of labor on the batarian planet and represents (or misrepresents) much of its history. Two decades ago, Aratoht, like several planets in the Skyllian Verge, was claimed by both human and batarian governments, but the Alliance backed out after learning about the atmosphere's dangerously low pressure and oxygen levels. Instead, they concentrated their colonial efforts on planets that could support human life without the aid of domed habitats and rebreathers. Human governments saw it as a wise move; batarians saw it as cowardly.

The batarians rose to the colonization challenge, shipping in large numbers of laborers. They took the high financial costs and casualties due to accidents or logistical snafus in stride. Large-scale dumping of cyanobacteria has increased the oxygen in the atmosphere by a fraction of one percent, a modest increase that the Hegemony trumpets as a sign of their eventual victory. Short-term profits on Aratoht are largely made in the minerals sector through mining the extremely metal-rich planetary crust. The dark side to the mining does not appear on the propaganda poster--the majority of laborers are indentured servants or slaves.

Aratoht is rumored to have military bases on its surface and throughout its solar system, though details are heavily restricted by the Hegemony's Ministry of Information Control. Human merchant ships rarely come to the planet, outcompeted by local companies that benefit from heavy economic protections. The average Aratoht citizen only sees humans on the news, usually featured in stories of trials and executions of accused spies.</String>

		<String id="391622">Dr. Amanda Kenson's scientific team has cataloged three major discoveries on the artifact encased in the 157-Golgotha asteroid. First, the large artifact is rooted into the core of the asteroid and has a barrier that is similar to but much more powerful than a biotic stasis field. This gives it an unnatural resilience to alteration or damage and even prevents state-of-the-art laser drilling from extracting the smallest piece for analysis.

Second, the object's interior is energetically active with a quantum stasis field rivaling that of Prothean technology found in mass relays. Like those creations, it activates in response to threat, at which point the artifact consumes a phenomenal amount of power. Dr. Kenson's team believes the object draws this power directly from dark matter, though how is still unknown.

The third discovery is that the object broadcasts signals and information on many different spectra. One such pulse, suspected to be similar to a quantum entanglement communicator, reaches into Reaper territory. Another broadcast is infrasound, consistent with frequencies that trigger feelings of awe and fear in humans, a known factor in Reaper indoctrination. Kenson's laboratory is filled with equipment dedicated to monitoring any signal coming from the artifact in the hopes that some clue will prove the Reapers' undoing before it's too late.</String>

		<String id="391624">Discovering the age of a mass relay is not an easy task. Relays can shield themselves to preserve their integrity down to the quantum level, so taking a sample for analysis proves nigh impossible. Relays also maintain self-cleaning cycles, wiping away potential evidence, though damage or dormancy can cause this cycle to break down (such as in the case of the Charon Relay, which became covered in ice).

A breakthrough was recently made by Dr. Amanda Kenson, who revisited old methods of dating the relays by testing dust trapped in their gravity wells. By comparing the relative velocity of relays to that of the stars they orbit as well as the composition of the dust around dormant relays against the dust at known locations in their star systems, Kenson could create a timeline of when a relay passed through the dust. The result dates the relay back millions of years; some may even predate the Protheans.

Kenson concluded that the oldest known relay is in batarian space. Dubbed "Alpha," it resides near the star Bahak and is unusual in its potential range and versatility. Alpha usually sends and receives mass at the range of a normal secondary relay, but if certain controls are adjusted, it becomes powered by an unprecedented amount of dark energy that could send cargo to sixteen other relays and even across a great distance to the Citadel. Hegemony authorities have kept this quiet, fearing retaliation from Council species who would assume hostile intent if they found a sudden new route into their space. It goes without saying that the Reapers have no such fear.</String>

		<String id="500315">Utopia</String>
		<String id="500316">This idyllic agrarian world was one of the first human colonies established beyond the Charon mass relay. Eden Prime's fertile biosphere drew heavy immigration from the Systems Alliance and other human organizations.

In 2183, Eden Prime was attacked by a geth force led by the rogue Spectre Saren Arterius. Commander Shepard, responding to the attack, encountered a Prothean beacon that warned of imminent Reaper invasion. It is thanks to this beacon, and the Commander's quick action, that the galaxy has any chance of survival today.

Although the Reapers rushed past much of the Exodus Cluster in their plan to take Earth, it is clear the war has come to Eden Prime. Distress signals have jammed all available frequencies, fires burn in vast swaths across the arable land, and its once-extensive monorail system is twisted metal. Cerberus has much to lose if word of their ruthless attack on the human colony gets out. What they stand to gain must be equally valuable.

Colony Founded: 2152
Population: 4.2 million

		<String id="500319">Xanadu</String>
		<String id="500320">Xanadu's atmosphere is composed of methane and argon, while the planet's frozen surface is largely potassium with deposits of calcium. Its location in the deep cold of the outer system and the lack of valuable resources leave little to recommend it.

Orbital Distance: 101.7 AU
Orbital Period: 1029.9 Earth Years
Radius 3,730 km

		<String id="500321">Arcadia</String>
		<String id="500322">An unusually large terrestrial world, Arcadia has a dense atmosphere composed of nitrogen and helium. Its scorching hot surface is mainly composed of alkaline basalts, but metal deposits are plentiful.

Although several spectacular examples of columnar basalt formation offer scenic beauty, Arcadia's hostile environment has precluded commercial development.

Orbital Distance: 0.7 AU
Orbital Period: 0.6 Earth Years

		<String id="500323">Zion</String>
		<String id="500324">Zion is a hydrogen-helium gas giant even larger than Jupiter. Despite its deep gravity well and lethal radiation, it supports a small helium-3 mining industry. The reason is simple: as the only gas giant in the Utopia system, it is the only local source of fuel for Eden Prime's power stations and spaceports.

Zion has 112 natural satellites, ranging from orbiting asteroids to the moon of Asphodel, which is large enough to retain a thick atmosphere.

		<String id="510187">Commander Shepard. I'm Lieutenant Tolan. I've heard about your exploits against the Reapers.</String>
		<String id="510188">Your mission on Virmire holds special renown in STG. The assistance you lent our team tipped the balance.</String>
		<String id="510189">But now... I'm not so sure.</String>
		<String id="510190">You helped Captain Kirrahe's squad destroy Saren's cure for the genophage.</String>
		<String id="510191">Which is ironic, considering you've come here to safeguard another cure. I wonder if Kirrahe's men died in vain.</String>
		<String id="510192">Is it? Seems to me that's the same thing the turians want.</String>
		<String id="510193">You've revealed the existence of krogan who are immune to the genophage, Commander.</String>
		<String id="510194">Word will get out. We're now a prime target.</String>
		<String id="510195">And us? Will we pay for your political expediency?</String>
		<String id="510196">I was part of the team that found them on Tuchanka. I wanted them eliminated, but our scientists insisted we bring them back for study.</String>
		<String id="510197">I don't need science to tell me fertile krogan will be dangerous. I hope we don't pay for misguided mercy.</String>
		<String id="510198">You're upsetting a balance of power that's stood for a thousand years.</String>
		<String id="510199">And if you succeed, we're ill-prepared to face a resurgent krogan.</String>
		<String id="510200">For now. But once the Reapers are dealt with, history will repeat.</String>
		<String id="510201">And then we neutered them when we realized our mistake--the same mistake you're making all over again.</String>

		<String id="510461">Right now, it's exhausting. I'm an admiral in the middle of a war.</String>
		<String id="510462">It's better than exile. I know they only brought me back to help them, but...</String>
		<String id="510463">I just want us to get out of this alive. Everything else can wait.</String>
		<String id="510464">When the war started, the Admiralty Board asked for my help. I had more recent contact with the geth than most of my people.</String>
		<String id="510465">They hadn't filled the spot on the board left by my father. I was invited in.</String>
		<String id="510466">It's just a technicality. I'm far too young to be a real admiral.</String>
		<String id="510467">Don't sell yourself short, Tali. The board needed your expertise, you needed the authority that comes with rank.</String>
		<String id="510468">They offered to end my exile if I could help us retake the homeworld.</String>
		<String id="510470">Admiral Xen developed a scanning countermeasure that interferes with geth active scans.</String>
		<String id="510471">It's like a flashbang grenade. It effectively crippled the geth ships in combat. My fleet couldn't pass up the chance to attack.</String>
		<String id="510472">It only works against the geth, unfortunately.</String>
		<String id="510473">Their AI lets them use extremely detailed ladar pings. Xen's countermeasure overwhelmed them with garbage data.</String>
