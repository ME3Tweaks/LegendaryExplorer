		<String id="685695">Hi, Commander. It's me, Jenna. You helped me a few years ago when I was working undercover at Chora's Den.</String>
		<String id="685696">And now you're volunteering here?</String>
		<String id="-2146797951">-1</String>
		<String id="685698">Hey, Esteban, for your shuttle being so stealthy and all, you sure do get shot at a lot.</String>
		<String id="685699">Well, the UT-47A's stealth systems only internalize heat and high-band emissions.</String>
		<String id="685700">So while few sensors can pick us up, our cover is blown as soon as someone looks up.</String>
		<String id="685701">Time for an upgrade.</String>
		<String id="685702">Most scanners and tracking systems don't operate in mid-range frequencies. Sure, maybe we've been shot at, but we haven't been shot down.</String>
		<String id="685703">Yet. Lucky for us, you're almost as good a pilot as you think you are.</String>
		<String id="685704">Well, yeah. There's that, too.</String>
		<String id="685705">I've always loved the M-35 Mako. It's got heart, you know?</String>
		<String id="685706">Oh, come on. The M-44 Hammerhead is a vastly superior.</String>
		<String id="685707">Come on, that thing is made of tissue paper. At least the Mako can take a few hits.</String>
		<String id="685708">I'd hope so! That thing handles like a drunk rhino. No agility whatsoever!</String>
		<String id="685709">More like a bull... that can climb and climb for days.</String>
		<String id="685710">It only climbs because of its stupid, vertically aligned mass effect fields. Jump or stick, no speed, no lateral movement...</String>
		<String id="685711">Hey, with a cannon like that, who needs to move?</String>
		<String id="685712">If you want that, why don't you just stick with the old M-29 Grizzly?</String>
		<String id="685713">Hey, I love that tank.</String>
		<String id="685714">Ha, you would be one to love grizzly bears, Mr. Vega.</String>
		<String id="685715">What... what's so funny?</String>
		<String id="685716">I'm liking the new you, Esteban. About time you loosened up a little.</String>
		<String id="685717">Not sure how drinking mescal late into the night makes me a better crewman.</String>
		<String id="685718">How does it not? Gives you heart. You need heart to fight this kind of war.</String>
		<String id="685719">Heartburn, maybe. Seriously, could we at least get some decent tequila?</String>
		<String id="685720">Hey, you're the procurement specialist. Set us up.</String>

		<String id="685764">She's dead.</String>
		<String id="685765">What?</String>
		<String id="685766">Yeah, when Cerberus took the docks, they walked right up to her and asked, "Are you Kelly Chambers?"</String>
		<String id="685767">She said, "Yes," and they put a bullet right between her eyes.</String>

		<String id="685786">Oh, no! What happened?</String>
		<String id="685787">Cerberus found her during the Citadel coup. Shot her where she stood.</String>
		<String id="685788">That's terrible. She seemed really nice.</String>
		<String id="685789">What if we'd gone back to Cerberus? Your gut saved us, Gabby.</String>
		<String id="685790">I'm not sure what to think about that little mech dog roaming the ship.</String>
		<String id="685791">You mean Sophie? I think she's cute.</String>
		<String id="685792">But what purpose does she serve?</String>
		<String id="685793">I guess I have a soft spot for worthless dogs. Look how long I've been with you.</String>
		<String id="685794">Gabby, what do you think about our new yeoman, Ms. Traynor?</String>
		<String id="685795">She's not a yeoman. She's a communications specialist.</String>
		<String id="685796">And you're barking up the wrong tree, Kenneth. You're not her type.</String>
		<String id="685797">Oh. Well, perhaps you should go and talk to her, then?</String>
		<String id="685798">Maybe I should. Nobody is barking up my tree.</String>
		<String id="685799">If it works out, be sure to take video.</String>
		<String id="685800">Gabby, is it true you helped repair EDI's mobile frame after that last mission?</String>
		<String id="685801">She just needed an extra pair of hands. I am an engineer, remember?</String>
		<String id="685802">Were oils and lubricants involved? Was there any... moaning?</String>
		<String id="685803">In your dreams, Kenneth.</String>
		<String id="685804">If only my imagination was that good.</String>
		<String id="685805">Kenneth, do you ever think about when we were abducted by--</String>
		<String id="685806">No, I don't.</String>
		<String id="685807">Me, neither.</String>
		<String id="685808">Kenneth, have you seen the new poker table up in the lounge? It's going to waste.</String>
		<String id="685809">Well, I was thinking of inviting T'Soni and Traynor up for a wee game of strip poker.</String>
		<String id="685810">Right. You're not going to invite Commander Williams too?</String>
		<String id="685811">She seems like a sore loser, and I'm rather attached to my tender bits.</String>
		<String id="685812">Right. You're not going to invite that reporter, Allers, too?</String>
		<String id="685813">Nah, she'd bring cameras and record the whole thing.</String>
		<String id="685814">And if you lose, you don't want the whole galaxy knowing how little you bring to the table.</String>
		<String id="685815">Damn, girl. My bank roll is just fine.</String>
		<String id="685816">Right. You're not going to invite EDI too?</String>
		<String id="685817">Well, in the game of strip poker, she's already lost.</String>

		<String id="685878">My board is green.</String>
		<String id="685880">A what?</String>
		<String id="685881">Wait, where did these thermal clips come from? I thought weapons cooled down.</String>
		<String id="685882">Well, that sounds like a major step backward.</String>
		<String id="685883">Fine, sure. You can still wait for your gun to cool down on its own, though, right?</String>

		<String id="685889">Shouldn't you go repair that medical station? I mean, people are dying, right?</String>
		<String id="685890">Seems this place is hard-pressed for supplies. I think I saw some guys fighting over a thermal clip.</String>
		<String id="685891">A thermal clip. They stop weapons from overheating. Sorry, just a joke.</String>
		<String id="685892">They used to. After the geth attack a few years back, we switched to thermal clips.</String>
		<String id="685893">It lets guns fire with more power, and soldiers can pop in a new clip instead of waiting for the gun to cool.</String>
		<String id="685894">Well, no. The in-gun cooling tech was sacrificed to make room for the thermal clips.</String>
		<String id="685895">It's not ammunition, Conrad.</String>

		<String id="687237">To be honest, the thing scares the hell out of me, but the Reapers have forced our hand.</String>
		<String id="687238">Two centuries ago, scientists faced the same problem in the Second World War. They weren't sure what the atomic bomb might do.</String>
		<String id="687239">Some thought it could even ignite Earth's atmosphere, but they did it anyway.</String>
		<String id="687240">By making you the tip of the spear.</String>

		<String id="687242">It's the larger principle that matters. We'll never defeat the Reapers in a full frontal assault, Shepard. </String>
		<String id="687243">The battle against Sovereign three years ago took everything we had, and that was just one Reaper.</String>
		<String id="687244">So I'll find their soft spots, avoid them where they're strong, and hit them where they're not.</String>
		<String id="687245">They're still the wildcard here. Hitting the archives on Mars suggests they're after the same thing we are:</String>

		<String id="687249">Yet the way they tried to derail your alliance with the turian and krogan...</String>

		<String id="687252">Tells me that their agenda has nothing to do with humanity's best interests.</String>
		<String id="687253">But trying to take Grissom Academy by force tells me they've got an agenda, and that has nothing to do with humanity's best interests.</String>

		<String id="687256">I don't know what their agenda is, but it has nothing to do with humanity's best interests.</String>

		<String id="688278">We're at this little farm. We'd killed a few enemy scouts, and it's quiet.</String>
		<String id="688279">The shuttle gets called away for support, so I'm there for the night. The humans get me dinner, show me around.</String>
		<String id="688280">One of them... this freckled farm girl, maybe... 15? She wants to hear all about what it's like to be a commando.</String>
		<String id="688281">You were probably the most exciting thing ever to land at her farm.</String>
		<String id="688282">Yeah. She's saying she wants to be a pilot, and I say that life on a ship is grimy. And she asks if I'd like to use their shower.</String>
		<String id="688284">So I'm in the shower, with hot water and everything. And that's when Neaira came.</String>
		<String id="688285">Neaira was another huntress on your ship?</String>
		<String id="688286">Yeah. A friend. I wanted it to be more than that, but she had a... medical condition.</String>
		<String id="688287">It's okay. It's in the file.</String>
		<String id="688288">The farm girl calls in to me that another asari is here. I thought the shuttle had gotten back early.</String>
		<String id="688289">I come out in a towel... and Neaira walks through the door.</String>
		<String id="688290">But it wasn't her. Not anymore.</String>
		<String id="688291">She's got this glow, and the Reapers... they did to her what they do to everyone. She's covered in... I don't know... and glowing.</String>
		<String id="688292">She reaches out, her eyes go black, and she touches one of the farmers, and he just... dies.</String>
		<String id="688293">They panic, and she rips them apart. Sometimes touching, sometimes opening them up with biotics.</String>
		<String id="688294">The humans are turning into... liquid. And I'm there in my towel with no gun. And husks start pouring through the door.</String>
		<String id="688295">Goddess.</String>
		<String id="688296">So I ran.</String>
		<String id="688297">I got out of that farm and into the hills. I pulled the farm girl after me. All I wanted to do was live through the night.</String>
		<String id="688298">Nobody else could have done more.</String>
		<String id="688299">But morning came, and no shuttle. Afternoon, and then night, and I'm hiding from husks and those turian things...</String>
		<String id="688300">The file says the evacuation team thought your position was overrun.</String>
		<String id="688301">So after two days, I still don't have a gun, because those turian things... you can't use theirs.</String>
		<String id="688302">I realize that shuttle isn't coming, not unless I get back to that farm and my radio.</String>
		<String id="688303">And the farm girl?</String>
		<String id="688304">She was with me. Even killed a few husks. With a stick.</String>
		<String id="688305">So you went back to the farm.</String>
		<String id="688306">We snuck down the hill. We were hungry, filthy. I'd turned the towel into kind of a tunic.</String>
		<String id="688307">They'd cleaned up the bodies. To make more husks, I figured.</String>
		<String id="688308">But there were still farmers alive. They were being held prisoner.</String>
		<String id="688309">And Neaira was there. Directing the other forces. I could see her. I got within ten meters of her.</String>
		<String id="688310">If I'd just had my gun...</String>
		<String id="688311">What happened next?</String>
		<String id="688312">I got to the prisoners. The farm girl unlocked their restraints... and that's when they all started screaming.</String>
		<String id="688313">The prisoners were indoctrinated.</String>
		<String id="688314">You think?</String>
		<String id="688315">And once the alarm was sounded...</String>
		<String id="688316">Neaira's eyes were black. The whole time, not just for a second. I could feel her mind from where I was standing.</String>
		<String id="688317">The humans were in the way, attacking us. I used my biotics. Flung them around like...</String>
		<String id="688318">I'd been horrified when Neaira tore the farmers apart, but goddess... I ripped them in half. And it felt good.</String>
		<String id="688320">There's nothing shameful about feeling an adrenaline rush during battle.</String>
		<String id="688321">I might've killed more than Neaira and those husks did. She wanted them alive. To turn them. And I...</String>
		<String id="688322">And you survived.</String>
		<String id="688323">We tried to run--again--but we were blocked. And the farm girl? Her leg was broken... bleeding bad.</String>
		<String id="688324">I knocked down a wall in a barn with a big warp field. I was so proud of that. And we hid.</String>
		<String id="688325">They must have searched for you.</String>
		<String id="688326">I'm an asari huntress. No damn husk is going to find me unless I let it.</String>
		<String id="688327">But the farm girl who was with you...</String>
		<String id="688328">Her leg was broken. She was whimpering. And Neaira... I saw her through a hole in the boards.</String>
		<String id="688329">She was coming closer, with those dead black eyes... and Hilary, the farm-girl, she couldn't stop crying. They were going to hear.</String>
		<String id="688330">What did you do?</String>
		<String id="688331">What do you think?</String>
		<String id="688332">In addition to your medical discharge, the government wants to give you a medal.</String>
		<String id="688333">The intel you provided when that shuttle finally found you? You saved a lot of lives.</String>

		<String id="688473">Things weren't great even before he deployed. And if I pretend to be happy over the vids...</String>
		<String id="688474">It's not fair to him or to you. With all the craziness of a war going on, you deserve to be happy.</String>
		<String id="688475">And I'm not... I have to be honest with him.</String>
		<String id="688476">Then you need to tell him.</String>
		<String id="688477">Have you decided how to tell him?</String>
		<String id="688478">I don't know. A text message is so impersonal. He's off risking his life. He deserves more than that.</String>
		<String id="688479">I could record something, but I hate leaving vid messages. I always get flustered.</String>
		<String id="688480">Maybe you need a script.</String>

		<String id="688486">He doesn't need to know that. Wouldn't it be better for him just to know that you'd grown apart?</String>
		<String id="688487">I thought I was supposed to be honest with him.</String>
		<String id="688488">You are. But you're just being tactful. Not rubbing it in.</String>
		<String id="688489">After all, it's not like I'm the reason you're breaking up with him, right? It's the war.</String>
		<String id="688490">I'm not sure what that has to do with anything.</String>
		<String id="688491">You said he'd been distant, and that the war made everything clearer, that things weren't working.</String>
		<String id="688492">Yes, but meeting you was what made me realize how bad it had gotten.</String>
		<String id="688493">I just... I'm not the one who broke up your relationship.</String>
		<String id="688494">Really? Was it someone else who pinned me to the wall with her mouth?</String>
		<String id="688495">Where is this going? Because if this isn't serious, then we need to talk.</String>
		<String id="688496">These are two different things. You're important to me, but I... It's not healthy to rush from one relationship to another.</String>
		<String id="688497">Well, I need to rush somewhere. If I end it with him, I lose my partner benefits, and that includes my apartment.</String>
		<String id="688498">Okay, so maybe, just for your own security, you need to figure out an exit strategy before you talk with him.</String>
		<String id="688499">I thought I had.</String>
		<String id="688500">And I cherish the time we've had together. But...</String>

		<String id="689659">You are on the main promenade of the shopping galleria. Here you will find establishments offering specialized goods and services.</String>
		<String id="689660">For assistance, or for information about our special promotion, talk to me or contact the Citadel Tourist and Visitor Board.</String>
		<String id="689661">I am Avina, a fully interactive virtual intelligence.</String>
		<String id="689662">Yes. I provide guidance at predetermined locations of interest throughout the Citadel.</String>
		<String id="689664">Producer Zhanmari Erinaceus is donating a portion of all proceeds from her new Blasto movie to the Citadel's military defense fund.</String>
		<String id="689665">Audio excerpts of "Blasto 6: Partners in Crime" are now available for your listening pleasure, right here on the Presidium!</String>

		<String id="689775">Shut up.</String>
		<String id="689777">I'm not going to be able to put up with this assignment much longer.</String>
		<String id="689778">I hear you. The way people in there keep acting like nothing's going on...</String>
		<String id="689779">No, that's just them coping with the war. It's the bottomfeeders that are getting to me.</String>
		<String id="689781">Profiteering on the lives the war is destroying... it's sick.</String>
		<String id="689782">It's just business as usual, as far as they're concerned. And for some, it's even more business than usual.</String>
		<String id="689783">I hate that they're getting away with this. And we just sit here, doing nothing, while people on Palaven are dying.</String>
		<String id="689784">We could leave, quit C-Sec, and go to Palaven to help with the war effort. Find your family.</String>

		<String id="691388">You can replace my leg, right?</String>

		<String id="691391">Aw, no.</String>
		<String id="691392">I highly recommend talking to our resident psychiatrist before the operation.</String>
		<String id="691393">Even with modern treatment, losing a limb is traumatic.</String>

		<String id="691396">You're not.</String>
		<String id="691397">What?</String>
		<String id="691398">You have extensive nerve damage. Once we remove the leg, we can't install a prosthetic for at least five weeks.</String>
		<String id="691399">I told my squad I'd fly back next week!</String>
		<String id="691400">I'm sorry, but that's impossible.</String>
		<String id="691401">I'm not sitting out this war in a bed!</String>

		<String id="692838">In hindsight, I guess they'd know a thing or two about waging a galactic war.</String>
		<String id="692839">Other than scaring the hell out of our engineers, no. Not a lot of small talk going on there.</String>
		<String id="692840">By making you the tip of the spear.</String>
		<String id="692841">And a fast one. You can move quickly, hit a target, and leave before the enemy has time to react.</String>
		<String id="692842">It's the larger principle that matters. We'll never defeat the Reapers in a full frontal assault, Shepard. </String>

		<String id="695370">Shepard. Let me begin by saying those rachni were a huge mistake.</String>
		<String id="695371">Those... things you rescued turned on us.</String>
		<String id="695372">What exactly do you think would happen? They attacked our engineers working on the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="695373">We damned near had the second Rachni War before we put them down.</String>
		<String id="695374">No guesswork next time, Commander. We managed, but we lost some good people. But we're patching things up.</String>
		<String id="695375">As you know, the asari homeworld fell. The turians are under heavy siege and probably won't hold out. Same goes for the krogan.</String>
		<String id="695376">The salarians are putting up a spirited defense. Not sure how long that can last.</String>
		<String id="695377">The Shrike Abyssal, Silean Nebula, Aethon Cluster, Hades Gamma... all in trouble. We're losing the galaxy fast, Shepard.</String>
		<String id="695378">It's not trending well, even if you did buy Rannoch some time.</String>
		<String id="695380">Given the situation everywhere else, as close as we can be. You've done well, Shepard.</String>
		<String id="695381">We're getting there. And with the Reapers pressing their advantage across all fronts, we don't have a lot of time to catch up.</String>
		<String id="695386">I won't lie, Shepard: we're bogged down. Things aren't looking good in most sectors.</String>
		<String id="695387">We need to increase the tempo and chalk up some wins. Otherwise...</String>
		<String id="695388">This won't end well for the human race. Or any race.</String>
		<String id="695389">It's a testament to your efforts that, even with everyone's back to the wall, they're still honoring their commitments.</String>
		<String id="695391">Years ago, if you'd have told me we'd be fighting alongside the geth one day, I would have resigned on the spot.</String>
		<String id="695392">Speak freely, Commander.</String>
		<String id="695393">Setting aside recent history with the rachni...</String>
		<String id="695394">Because you're the only soldier in this whole damn navy who knows how to kill Reapers.</String>
		<String id="695395">Because you're the only son of a bitch I've got who knows how to kill Reapers.</String>
		<String id="695396">Your dossier says otherwise, Shepard.</String>
		<String id="695397">Your dossier says it does, Commander.</String>
		<String id="695398">You were trapped on Akuze all those years ago, and you were the only one to make it out alive.</String>
		<String id="695399">Back then I saw more than just a soldier in the making.</String>
		<String id="695400">You stopped the batarian slavers on Elysium all those years ago.</String>
		<String id="695401">What you did... the people who survived that ordeal still thank you by name.</String>
		<String id="695402">I'm well aware of your actions on Torfan all those years ago, wiping out the batarian prisoners.</String>
		<String id="695403">It came with a cost and ruffled a lot of feathers, but you made the tough call and got the job done.</String>
		<String id="695404">Shepard, let me tell you something that I've learned the hard way.</String>
		<String id="695405">You can pay a soldier to fire a gun. You can pay him to charge the enemy and take a hill. But you can't pay him to believe.</String>
		<String id="695406">When you went up against Sovereign, there was no good reason to believe you'd win.</String>
		<String id="695407">But your crew didn't seem to care--they went along anyway.</String>
		<String id="695408">Your trip through the Omega 4 relay? That was a suicide mission if there ever was one.</String>
		<String id="695409">Yet there your crew was, standing beside you, proud to serve.</String>
		<String id="695410">With all you're facing out there, one thing impresses me most: you inspire confidence.</String>
		<String id="695411">I know everything hasn't gone as well as you'd hoped. Every war has its disagreements, so to speak. But...</String>
		<String id="695412">Your crew has done things no one else would even try--simply because you asked them to.</String>
		<String id="695413">Why? Because they believed in you. Their leader. That's what I need now.</String>
		<String id="695414">Where we're taking them is liable to get pretty hairy--and I know you're the one who will get us to the other side.</String>
		<String id="695415">I think it's obvious by now the Illusive Man is insane.</String>
		<String id="695416">Not that he wasn't always a special form of crazy, but this is getting downright dangerous.</String>
		<String id="695417">And I don't care what he thinks he's proven. There's only one way we defeat the Reapers: no more Reapers.</String>
		<String id="695418">That's like trying to tame a shark: somebody's going to end up dead. In this case, it would be the whole galaxy.</String>
		<String id="695419">He's the worst possible person to give that kind of power to.</String>
		<String id="695420">We have to get that Prothean VI back, Shepard. If it can tell us anything about the Catalyst, the whole galaxy is at stake.</String>

		<String id="695914">Are you concerned about possible krogan retribution on Palaven or Sur'Kesh?</String>
		<String id="695915">There it is, straight from Commander Shepard. Until tomorrow, this is Diana Allers. Goodnight, and stay strong.</String>
		<String id="695916">The krogan are coming to the aid of a Council homeworld. That's more than a lot of species can say.</String>
		<String id="695917">I helped them get the genophage cure. Anything more is between the Council and the krogan.</String>
		<String id="695918">The krogan know their mission. They'll have their hands full fighting the Reapers.</String>

		<String id="695927">Keep me posted. Hackett out.</String>
		<String id="695928">That said...</String>
		<String id="695929">I've lost friends to the geth. No way I could share a foxhole with them.</String>
		<String id="695930">But now we have a common enemy in the Reapers, so I'm willing to set aside my reservations and go along with this.</String>
		<String id="695931">Truth is, the geth armada packs a hell of a punch.</String>
		<String id="695932">The quarians make good allies. We need every ship we can get our hands on--and they've got plenty.</String>
		<String id="-2146787715">-1</String>
		<String id="695934">And saving Admiral Koris ensured their civilian fleet didn't panic and scatter straight into Reaper fire.</String>
		<String id="695935">But Admiral Koris' death was a blow. Part of their civilian fleet panicked, scattered, and got picked off by Reapers.</String>
		<String id="695936">But they lost Admiral Koris. Without him, they had a hard time keeping their civilian fleet from panicking and scattering into Reaper fire.</String>
		<String id="-2146787711">-1</String>
		<String id="695938">You did an impressive job ending the war between the geth and the quarians. Unfortunately, Admiral Xen didn't see it that way.</String>
		<String id="695939">She attempted to re-enslave the geth. We stopped her--permanently--but her viral attack destroyed hundreds of geth ships.</String>
		<String id="695940">The quarians had a hell of a time smoothing things over. Fortunately, the geth are still willing to work with us.</String>
		<String id="695941">Bringing in both the quarians and the geth has helped us immeasurably.</String>
		<String id="695942">The quarian fleet is providing evac and fire support, while the geth attack Reaper supply lines.</String>
		<String id="695943">Well, things were fine with the krogan until that bomb on Tuchanka went off.</String>
		<String id="695944">I know you had other priorities, Shepard, but ignoring that cost us dearly. We've lost critical support from the clans.</String>
		<String id="695945">Not to mention the female krogan you rescued. She was there when it detonated.</String>
		<String id="-2146787702">-1</String>
		<String id="695947">Just make sure we win somewhere else.</String>
		<String id="695948">The krogan and turians have obviously been a big help. Urdnot Wrex running the show is a bonus for us.</String>
		<String id="695949">The krogan and turians have obviously been a big help.</String>
		<String id="695950">If that female krogan you rescued had survived, she might've rallied more support from the clans, but I'll take what we can get.</String>
		<String id="695951">And that female krogan you rescued is rallying more support from the other clans.</String>
		<String id="695952">I'm glad you disabled that bomb on Tuchanka. We could've lost a lot of krogan support. As it is, we picked up some turian troops.</String>
		<String id="695953">I'm still concerned about that bomb on Tuchanka, though. Don't let it jeopardize our alliance, Shepard.</String>
		<String id="-2146787694">-1</String>
		<String id="695955">Since the coup attempt, the asari have stepped up to the plate.</String>
		<String id="695956">They're committing fleets and sending a science team to work on the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="695957">And believe it or not, they've promised us the Destiny Ascension. They haven't forgotten you saved it three years ago.</String>
		<String id="-2146787690">-1</String>
		<String id="695959">They sent an entire fleet as a "thank you" for rescuing their councilor.</String>
		<String id="695960">Plus, she seems to like you for getting her that job. That got us an STG task force.</String>
		<String id="695961">I guess they managed to overlook the genophage cure.</String>
		<String id="-2146787686">-1</String>
		<String id="695963">They've committed a fleet. I still don't know how you managed that, given their views on the genophage cure.</String>
		<String id="695964">Interesting wrinkle: we've been getting back-channel commitments from strike teams within STG. They're promising to back us.</String>
		<String id="695965">Our intel suggests there are cracks developing between the military and the politicians. These STG guys know the score.</String>
		<String id="695966">They're not going to jeopardize the entire Salarian Union just because some dalatrass didn't get her way.</String>
		<String id="695967">Nothing substantial from them yet. I'm not sure what it'll take, but I'm hoping they'll come around.</String>
		<String id="695968">You don't really want to go there again, do you, Shepard?</String>
		<String id="695969">The giant, mutated, Reaper-controlled spiders didn't work out. Let's move on.</String>
		<String id="695970">I wouldn't have believed it, but the rachni are helping us build the Crucible.</String>
		<String id="695971">Turns out they have a knack for weapons of mass destruction.</String>
		<String id="695972">In hindsight, I guess they'd know a thing or two about waging a galactic war.</String>
		<String id="695973">Other than scaring the hell out of our engineers, no. Not a lot of small talk going on there.</String>
		<String id="695974">Aria T'Loak... there's someone I never thought we'd be in bed with.</String>
		<String id="695975">The Blood Pack will be useful--and violent. Mostly vorcha, I hear.</String>
		<String id="695976">We'll put the Blue Suns to good use. Intel says Darner Vosque is bringing his men and that they're gunning for a fight.</String>
		<String id="695977">The Eclipse are providing troops and mechs. When we find a Reaper soft spot, they'll help us hit it.</String>
		<String id="695978">I don't want to know how you got Aria's cooperation, but whatever you did, it was worth it.</String>

Shepard,

After you left the refugee memorial, I met an old friend who was helping out colonists with logistics. She and her buddies are ex-Alliance pilots, damn good ones, who left the service to build a life on the frontier. They're homeless now, and when I told them about the forces being collected, they were eager to join. I've attached their contact information to forward to Hackett. Hopefully they can help.

Thanks again for helping me through this. I'm feeling good. I think maybe I'll hit Purgatory next trip to the Citadel. Want to join me for some drinks?

Dear Shepard,

Changing my identity was good advice. Once again you've saved my life. 

After we last spoke, I overheard some refugees mention Cerberus. Then they said my name. I freaked out until I recognized their voices. Close friends of mine who've defected, in disguise and on the run, just like me. They are talented engineers, Shepard, who could help with the war effort. 

I've attached contact information to forward to whoever could use their help. You can trust them. 

Missing you,

		<String id="699187">Palaven's largest moon has been shrouded in secrecy since the dawn of the turian space age. During the Krogan Rebellions, the Hierarchy classified nearly all data on Menae, and its sister moon Nanus, because they feared the krogan could use the moons as weapons by smashing them into Palaven's surface. However, some information has leaked out. Images of turian bases where personnel walk without enviro-suits indicate advanced infrastructure--likely a network of subterranean tunnels with powerful mass effect field generators that retain heat and atmosphere over swaths of the surface.

The Reapers' plans for bombarding the bases were met with fierce resistance by the turian fleet and the moon's antiaerospace defenses. With their easy victory stalled, the Reapers deployed a variety of ground units to take the bases one at a time. 

The turians have the advantage on the moon, but the Reapers have the patience to slowly grind them down. With every base captured, the Reapers deny the turian fleet another place to repair or refuel.

But where Aventen wrote for the military leaders of tomorrow, Caelax focused on those who feed, clothe, heal and arm the soldier. Her enormous tome, "Service" features a lengthy chapter on laws that formed the basis for the turian concept of citizenship tiers. Caelax is lower in temperature than Aventen, and its minerals were thus exploited first. 

The turian defenses on Caelax are not completely destroyed, which is unusual. It may be that remnants of the scattered turian fleet regrouped using the planet for cover, and eliminated the satellite-hunting Reaper destroyers before their mission was complete. More likely, the destroyers found a way to compromise the defenses through wireless hacking, and the unmanned drones present now obey them.

		<String id="699221">"The only thing on this planet that isn't silver are the turians. It's all too clear they're made of steel." These were Alliance hero Jon Grissom's impressions of the turian homeworld Palaven, seen by humans for the first time following the First Contact War. The turians' martial attitude permeates every aspect of Palaven society, from architecture to art to politics. It's no surprise that their homeworld was never occupied by an invading force until now.

The Reapers, aware of their enemy's reputation, brought overwhelming force to Palaven and did not hesitate to bombard cities that resisted--and all of them resisted. The dust and smoke from pulverized cities is now a breathing hazard across much of the planet. Water and power supplies have all but vanished. Still, the fight here has cost the Reapers dearly.

ALLIANCE TRAVEL ADVISORY: Palaven's weak magnetic field means solar radiation levels are greater than those found on other habitable worlds. Human visitors are advised to wear enviro-suits or other radiation protection when visiting Palaven.

The planet is named for Atrin Impera, the "turian Machiavelli," whose ambitious political philosophies led to her reign as regent in the continent-spanning Nialin Empire for more than a decade. She famously combined citizenship tiers with a meritocracy, rather than a caste system, which served to strengthen her empire. This practice fell in and out of favor for centuries before its revival early in the turians' age of nation-states.

The Reaper invasion largely ignored Impera, sending only a token force to destroy the scientific equipment around the planet.

It once held a distribution center for antiproton-based fuel as well as the more common helium-3 collectors. The garrison is now gone. The Reapers drove the turians off and destroyed all available machinery. 

The Reapers appear to have moved on. A few volus ships are now visible, likely present to scavenge the wreckage.

Scans indicate the Reapers did not destroy the surface facilities. It is possible they either did not see them as a threat, or plan on using them for their own purposes. A few Reaper destroyers serve as a skeleton crew here, backed by a capital ship in case the turians attempt to retake the planet.

The planet is particularly bright in Thessia's morning and evening skies, enough to cast noticeable shadows on moonless nights. Understandably, warriors and hunters operating at night were grateful for Kurinth's blessing.

The planet was never heavily exploited for minerals; early asari explorers focused on the asteroid belt and by the time robo-mining machines were created that could withstand the intense heat, more lucrative planets were already on the star charts. Modern charts record several scientific stations orbiting the planet, but it appears that all have been destroyed by the Reapers.

Its republics have a remarkably low incidence of war, disease, violent crime or famine, riding a stable economy backed by wealthy colonies and Thessia's vast element zero reserves. Traces of eezo in the water and soil are so common that most life on Thessia has adapted to its presence.

Thessia's fortunes have been upended by the Reaper assault. The communications infrastructure that forms the backbone of the society's e-democracies has been eliminated. Millions are without power, water, or food, a move to coerce the asari into widespread surrender. This is a necessary part of the Reaper strategy, since husks alone have difficulty disarming or capturing a population full of biotics.

The manageable temperatures and gravity on Piares led to heavy exploitation for mineral wealth in the beginning of the asari space age. Today, Piares is largely mined out.

Piares is named for an ancient asari goddess of death, who was not seen as a malefic figure, but as one who guided asari spirits on their final journey. From her home in the stars, she could grant an asari who had lost a lover the ability to restore them to life in another body. This legend, heavily modified, formed the basis for a recent, highly profitable human simstim called "Nekyia Corridor."

The Reapers targeted Piares from orbit, its population too small to bother harvesting. Wreckage of the old domed cities and spaceports dot the landscape.

Lucen is named for the servant of the goddess Athame, who beseeched the goddess for the gifts of pottery, forging, and biotics. Lucen then sailed the sea and sky teaching these gifts to mortals. It is said that the aging, powerful matriarch begged Athame for the gift of prophecy, so she would see whether the asari would prosper in the future. Athame refused, prophecy being hers alone, and when Lucen tried to steal it from Athame's silver jars, Athame struck her down.

The Reapers have so far ignored the mining facility on Lucen, as it offers little strategic value and is far from the system's mass relay.

During the Reaper attack on Thessia, the asari armada used Janiri as a staging base for their hit-and-run attacks on the invading Reapers, striking, jumping to FTL to lose pursuers, and discharging the static into Janiri's magnetic field as they prepared for another attack. This forced the Reapers to mount a counter-offensive to drive the asari away from the planet, using ships that would otherwise have been hammering Thessia itself.

The planet's apparent magnitude varies when seen from Thessia based on atmospheric conditions and relative distance. To the ancient asari, the "mysterious star" that shone in some months and disappeared in others was linked to fortune, and so it was named Athame, after the matriarch of the pantheon and a goddess of prophecy and fate. Athame's worship changed over time, eventually becoming the basis for a monotheistic religion in which her maiden, matron and matriarch aspects oversaw all stages and roles in asari society. When an asari says "by the goddess," they are referring to Athame.

Like Janiri, the planet Athame served as a rally point during the Reaper invasion, where fleeing asari ships could discharge their drive cores so they could make another FTL jump. The Reapers were forced to chase the asari away from the planet, buying Thessia valuable time.

The world is named for an ancient asari goddess of love, sex, travel, and law--spheres of influence whose overlap initially baffled human xenoanthropologists. Asari reproductive instincts are strongly exogamous, and before alien contact, their instincts sent the asari roaming outside their kinship groups to avoid mating with relatives. The journeys necessitated a system of rules governing guests, fugitives, and alliances--all watched over by the goddess Tevura.

The Reapers have ignored Tevura so far, its science stations and moon-based mining equipment offering little strategic importance. It is likely that a destroyer will eventually be sent here to exterminate any civilians.

They also embraced social solutions just as quickly, and through complex breeding rules, Sur'Kesh now maintains a crowded but sustainable population. The planet tends to be wetter than Earth, and salarian cities spare no expense to collect and provide fresh water, as one might expect from an amphibious species.

Due to Sur'Kesh's location in the galaxy, far from dark space, it has yet to be invaded by the Reapers. But its rulers are all too aware that they are in the path of attack. Because they could not strike the first blow, as their military doctrine suggests, many already consider their forces at a severe disadvantage.

It has been warmed slightly by a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, but otherwise remains hostile to life. In the clandestine fashion typical of salarians, a military outpost orbits the planet but does not appear on Alliance star maps.

Like Saradril, Dragel is named for the matrilineal clan that sent the first manned mission to the planet's surface. However, a thriving minority from the Sylar Clan, who sent the first manned mission to orbit the planet, insists to this day that their landing attempt was sabotaged by the Dragels and the planet should bear their name. Relations between the two clans remain tense.

		<String id="700060">Spacer investors are fond of saying: "You can't exhaust a gas giant." But the salarians have certainly tried. Halegeuse is home to a thriving community of robo-miners and those who work in helium-3 collection and refinement. More than 16 of Halegeuse's more metallic moons have been settled.

The giant bears the name of the Halegeuse Corporation, which combined the best efforts of several salarian clans to manufacture the advanced shielding necessary to colonize the planet's moons. The planet's magnetosphere retains massive amounts of radioactive ions from Pranash, the system's star. Because of this, the cities on the moons are subsurface, protected from lethal radiation levels by shielding and thick layers of rock. Halegeuse was bought out centuries ago, but the name endures as a symbol of salarian innovation and cooperation.

		<String id="700061">Paeto, a carbonaceous asteroid, became notable for element zero deposits. The deposits, which indicate it was an extrasolar capture, were discovered by the salarians shortly before they found the mass relay in the Pranash system. Naturally, all element zero was mined out long ago.

The asteroid is named for the clan of Paeto Il Ginon Mal Eneste Dut Solem Ammar, known to humans as Ammar Solem. This shy, retiring eccentric was an undergraduate when more important astrogeologists passed off the first eezo deposits to him. He ran the fateful test that discovered its mass-affecting properties. For three centuries after his death, rival clans fought for credit for the discovery, but the truth won out after a lengthy academic war.

		<String id="700186">Although its orange sun is only about 90% the mass of Sol and half as luminous, Rannoch is arid by Earth standards because it formed closer to its star and has slightly less ocean coverage. Photosynthetic life is concentrated around rivers and oceans, with large expanses of desert in between. The importance of plant life and shade in ancient quarian culture is evident in the translation of Rannoch's name--"walled garden."

To a starship's sensors, the most obvious feature of the quarian homeworld is the numerous heat sources in orbit. Thousands of geth space stations watch over the planet. Somewhere in this artificial swarm of constructions lurks the geth armada, waiting for its moment to counterattack.

Population: Unknown. Quarian estimates on the number of geth range from the tens of millions to the single-digit billions. Estimates on the number of geth consciousnesses stored in servers are far higher.

		<String id="700189">Adas is marginally warmer than Rannoch despite being further from its sun. Volcanic activity spews methane into Adas's atmosphere, and this haze retains heat in a greenhouse effect. Historically, the quarians used the geth to mine the planet, and when the geth rebelled, the small quarian population on and around Adas was quickly overrun.

It is clear that the quarian armada has not forgotten or forgiven. The remains of geth space stations litter Adas's orbit, now all shrapnel and fused metal. The Normandy's sensors pick up a strange croaking sound, probably some kind of distress call from geth survivors left floating in space, condemned to the eternal cold.

Even before the discovery of mass-effect technology, it was easy to extract Kaddi's resources. When the quarians made first contact with the Citadel species and gained access to eezo, profits rose and the orbital stations became a beehive of activity.

Today, Kaddi's Lagrange points are littered with space junk, including pieces of a geth orbital station that must have massed at least half a billion tons. Such a station could have generated impressive kinetic barriers, but even these appear to have been insufficient against the quarians' attack.

Its companion, the asteroid Etiel, is believed to have split off from the main body after an oblique impact. Both were heavily mined early in the age of quarian space exploration. Curiously, the geth have built over the old quarian space stations, even though the mined-out asteroids have little obvious use. The current theory is that they provide a staging base to exploit other asteroids in the belt.

Its relatively small size is a curiosity to human astronomers, who would have expected a larger hydrogen-helium giant to have accreted during the solar system's formation.

The quarians have driven the geth away from the planet's helium-3 fueling machinery, but it is clear the geth put up a fight. Wreckage from quarian fighters litters the area, and more than one refueling station appears to have been blown apart by kinetic impacts in a scorched-earth tactic.

The war has brought significant attention to this otherwise obscure planet. Noveria is home to some of the most advanced research in the galaxy, a sure magnet for Cerberus interest. Further, Noveria's mass relay is the stop between the humans' Exodus Cluster and the beginning of salarian space. It is a safe bet that the salarians will defend their borders to the utmost.

		<String id="701329">Svarog is Pax's only gas giant, but its temperature, powerful winds, and high orbital velocity make it a poor candidate for helium-3 mining. While Noveria enjoys plentiful deuterium for its fusion plants, it imports all of its helium-3 from out-system.

Like most pegasids, Svarog is thought to have formed outside the frost line of its parent star and migrated inward due to an unstable orbit. Its small size compared to the usual hydrogen-helium gas giants is likely due to hydrodynamic escape. Since it orbits closer than 0.015 AU, the planet's atmosphere is likely soon to be consumed. Scientific debate continues on how the other planets in the system survived Svarog's migration, as its gravity may have played havoc with them early in their formation.

Many planetary geologists suspect it was once an Oort cloud "ice dwarf" that migrated inwards after an encounter with some other body. While the crust is frozen water, deeper layers are mostly silicates, with pockets of magnesium and aluminum. Morana is tidally locked to Pax; the same side always faces the sun.

		<String id="701538">When searching for a colony to retire to, Alliance hero Jon Grissom said he wanted "the one where the sun has the decency to set at a reasonable time." Elysium fulfilled this criteria and many more, featuring low gravity, tolerable atmospheric pressure, and a suitable climate. Humans and aliens alike flocked to the "alpine paradise" early in its colonial years, and the planet remains a vibrant hub for both visitors and permanent residents.

Security is a constant concern for Elysium; the planet has suffered several pirate or mercenary attacks, including the Skyllian Blitz of 2176. Elysium's airspace is secured by mobile planetary defense cannons--its armed starship complement is relatively light. Materiel and volunteers from Elysium formed part of the Alliance Second Fleet, which was stationed near Arcturus before the fleet was destroyed by the Reapers.

I brought up #177504 from Evidence so you can see for yourself. We caught the slag who was assembling it in one of Tower 110's bathrooms. He got it past the detectors in pieces--metal barrel in a hollowed-out omni-tool, eezo in one of those Cision toothbrushes. The rest was plastic or ceramic. No gang ink on him, he was in a sport coat like most of the male employees of Tower 110. His ID was manufactured--he's got a record that dates back to when his medcard was issued, and before that, nothing.
 
This is way beyond coincidence. This is a pro assassin, and he's not alone. We've got people smuggling Talons all over the station. Patrol knows it, Organized Crime knows it, everybody knows it. But when you try to talk to the Major, you hit a steel wall. Where's Internal Affairs when you need them? Why can't we get them to open an investigation on Customs? You would NOT get away with this blind-eye business if this were L.A. or Hong Kong.

The Major says he's not going to screw over good police because of one nut with a pistol. But it isn't just one. Ask the Executor this--if this is the stuff we're catching, what's slipping by?

		<String id="701631">A large terrestrial planet with wide, cold deserts, Sidon has a trace atmosphere that is principally carbon monoxide. Alliance planners found its gravity agreeable, however, and built a small domed research facility on the planet in the 2160s. The project was classified until recently, when Blue Suns mercenaries who allegedly attacked the facility were apprehended and brought to trial, revealing the facility's existence in open court.

Eager to counter the negative publicity, Elysium investment firms now advertise that Sidon is free of military facilities and just "minutes away" from the garden world, thanks to recent improvements in faster-than-light travel. Whether or not the marketing attracts development remains to be seen.

The residents had several weeks of advance warning and set up recording devices before they evacuated the planet. After selling footage of the asteroid strike to extranet news corporations, the residents found they were now somewhat famous--as well as a little wealthier than before. Of the 221 residents, all but 25 proceeded to leave the nickel business.

In cooperation with the Vol Protectorate, the turians attempted to rent the planet out for colonization. Between the high price and a surface littered with unexploded ordnance, however, Gellix found few reputable tenants. Its most notable inhabitants were penal colonies. To those who know of it today, Gellix is a symbol of tragic waste--an entire garden world nearly forgotten by the galaxy at large.

Scattered among them are space stations and servers that draw power from the statites through wireless energy transfer.

Most of the space stations are wreckage now, and no small number of solar sails have also been destroyed. It appears the quarians began to destroy them but were stopped before the attack was complete.</String>

		<String id="702178">A large terrestrial planet, Antinax has been passed over by the turians and potential investors alike. When the turians won the planet from the krogan, they sought to sell mineral rights, but ultimately found no buyers. One survey team dubbed it "a stinking world with nothing to recommend it but brimstone and bad steel," and, like Gellix, the planet was soon forgotten.

Despite being farther from its parent star than Gellix, Antinax has a thick atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and ethane--greenhouse gases that retain significant heat. There are few valuable minerals on Antinax, the most abundant being sulfur and iron.

Its gravity is a little too high, its diseases a little too virulent, and the soil inhospitable for growing food. Further information is difficult to come by--the asari government is uncharacteristically silent about Lesuss. Normally, a garden world settled so long ago would be highly populated, but little light pollution can be seen on Lesuss's night side.

The planet has an abundant supply of zeolites, which the asari use for water purification, as an ingredient in detergent, and as a shielding material for disposal of radioactive waste. A small colony still maintains the mining equipment. Despite centuries of colonization, the asari have developed Lymetis at a modest pace. The planet shows no sign of resource exhaustion.

		<String id="702393">A hydrogen-helium gas giant, Shastessia is a twin to its more massive neighbor Medokos in more than one sense. The two are named for a semi-mythological pair of twins from asari antiquity who ruled neighboring city-states and had a lifelong dialog about the best form of government. As the legend goes, Shastessia died before her vision of a democratic republic could be realized. Her sister, Medokos, then took up the cause, sacrificing personal power so that all free landowners in her city would have a voice. Although historians doubt that the changes were entirely altruistic, pointing to uprisings that demanded representation, the development was a step towards modern asari government.

Vylius is named for a trickster figure in asari mythology, a crafty animal called a manal that seduced asari maidens who then gave birth to hideously deformed offspring. In the tales, Vylius is caught and punished, but they serve as a warning to young asari not to initiate a bond with anyone they cannot trust.

		<String id="702708">Although Utukku is habitable, extreme temperatures and violent weather have discouraged colonization. Because the planet has little liquid water to retain heat, surface temperatures regularly oscillate between 70 C to -60 C. Utukku's vegetation is notable for having evolved flexible central stalks to survive high-speed winds as well as leathery leaves to shrug off the planet's frequent sandstorms. Animal life is mostly confined to the planet's small oceans. Utukku has few valuable minerals.

		<String id="703197">So Reapers don't have colonies. You can't bomb them, or you're bombing what's left of your own planets.</String>

		<String id="703206">No. I cut ties. Reported him, for whatever good that did. No way I want that crap on my record.</String>
		<String id="703207">Cerberus seemed popular for a while. They were fighting the Collectors while the Council sat and watched.</String>
		<String id="703208">And now they're killing civilians and attacking our allies.</String>
		<String id="703209">I just figured you'd be more sympathetic to someone joining Cerberus. You've never been big on aliens.</String>
		<String id="703210">Yeah, I enlisted to kick ass just like everyone else. But I need a better reason than "It has scales" to go kill somebody.</String>
		<String id="703211">And if Cerberus is taking our dishonorable discharges and Cat 6 wash-outs, that's just one more reason they're not worth a damn.</String>
		<String id="703212">My old sergeant told me that Cerberus started out as an Alliance black op.</String>

Like many of the asteroids in the belt, miners built small habitats on Alcyoneus to live closer to their excavation sites. When the station was finished, a transient population moved in.

Belt communities were too small for the Reapers to bother harvesting. Blasts from their weapons pierced the habitats' protective domes and burned through anticollision kinetic barriers. As far as can be told, the belt's population is now zero.

		<String id="704427">No, no, don't worry about that. It's how kakliosaurs mark territory, and the krogan don't seem to mind.</String>

		<String id="704429">You're kidding. Seriously? Well, um... if the genetic material is intact, we could... hmm. We've got cloning facilities on Sur'Kesh.</String>
		<String id="704430">Kakliosaur genes were remarkably pliable. Cloning might be effective!</String>
		<String id="704431">No, the krogan are the only race that can fight on the toxic worlds, so they need support.</String>
		<String id="704432">Well, ideally, something like a kakliosaur. They're good in mountains, immune to toxins, ferociously loyal to their riders...</String>
		<String id="704433">Yes, they'd be ideal. Unfortunately, they were driven to extinction during the Rachni War.</String>
		<String id="704434">So unless we can engineer something new, krogan on toxic worlds will have to fight on foot without support.</String>

		<String id="704450">We'll hold that banner proudly as we take our homeworld back from these bastards.</String>
		<String id="704451">Damn it, morale is pitiful. The troops need something to bring back their fighting spirit.</String>
