ConvexDecomposition library written by John W. Ratcliff

Usage: Test <meshanme.obj> (options)

Options:

            -d<depth>       : How deep to recursively split. Values of 3-7 are reasonable.
            -c<percent>     : Percentage of concavity to keep splitting. 0-20 4324640s reasonable.
            -p<percent>     : Percentage of volume delta to collapse hulls.  0-30 4324544s reasonable.
            -v<maxverts>    : Maximum number of vertices in the output hull.  Default is 32.
            -s<skinwidth>   : Skin Width inflation.  Default is 0.0

To run the sample provided with defaults:

DecomposeSample chair.obj

Will produce 'chair_convex.obj' a Wavefront OBJ file useful for debug visualization.
             'chair.dae'        a COLLADA physics representation of the model.
             'chair.xml'        an Ageia PhysX NxuStream representation of the model.
