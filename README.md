Legendary Explorer is a fan-made modding toolkit for the _Mass Effect Legendary Edition_ and the original _Mass Effect Trilogy_ on PC. Legendary Explorer does not support modding Mass Effect games designed for other platforms.

This application is developed and maintained by ME3Tweaks and contains bleeding edge features for developers. Development is done on the [beta branch](https://github.com/ME3Tweaks/LegendaryExplorer/tree/Beta), and releases are merged into the [master](https://github.com/ME3Tweaks/LegendaryExplorer/tree/master) branch.

## Features
All stable releases starting with 3.0.7.0 are signed with the ME3Tweaks code signing certificate.

Some highlights of features that were developed on this fork:
 - An UnrealScript compiler and decompiler, allowing easy script editing.
 - Jumplists in the taskbar allow you to right click to open tools.
 - Many quality of life improvements in the UI, such as pressing enter to submit, opening files in other tools directly from tools themselves, smart recents menus
 - Package Editor has property relinking when drag/dropping between files for the entire tree. This saves a HUGE amount of time for users compared to the old manual way.
 - You can view Bio2DA tables natively in Bio2DA editor view in Package Editor.
 - You can edit levels using Pathfinding Editor, including placement of objects, pathfinding, and spline movement and recalculation of reparam tables
 - WPF rewrites of multiple tools to use a more modern design language - better DPI scaling, more features. These include PackageEditorWPF (and its contents), and SoundplorerWPF, with more on the way. All of these tools are being completely rewritten.
 - Integration of BioWare's plot databases, giving you extra info when working with plot data
 - Many more not listed here
  
You can get these releases in ME3Tweaks Mod Manager's Tools menu, or you can download from the releases tab above. Come to the [ME3Tweaks Discord](https://discord.gg/s8HA6dc) to talk with the developers. You can download nightlies from within Mod Manager as well.
