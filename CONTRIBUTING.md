# LEGENDARYEXPLORER CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
This document outlines the basic details about how you can contribute to the toolset.

### Contributing code
If you'd like to contribute code, feel free to come to [the ME3Tweaks Discord server](https://discord.gg/s8HA6dc) and we can always have a good chat about what you want to. Of course, you don't have to, but it will make both our lives easier. You can just fork and submit pull requests to this repository. Be aware this project is licensed as GPLv3 - any code you submit for pulls will be licensed under this. If your code is not compatible with GPLv3, it won't be accepted.

- __Fork the Beta branch__ &mdash; New code is pushed into the Beta branch before eventually being merged with the master (stable). Additional branches on this repository are sometimes made and are eventually folded (or abandoned) into the Beta branch. Nothing ever will directly commit to stable.
- __Examine the existing Issues__ &mdash; This is a great way to become familiar with current tasks and features on the roadmap. 

I do not allow other developers direct access onto the repo, any contributions must be done through a fork.

### Contributing other things
You might not be a coder, but you can still be useful. If you know binary formats for classes and exports (such as *Level*), or can show me detailed, reproducable steps for bugs you encounter, it goes a long way in helping things get fixed. Submit issues to this repository for things that don't take divine intervention to implement and I'll see what I can do. I am developing the toolset with certain developers in mind, and if you're a dev, you can be one of them. Tell me what you need, tell me what sucks to do in the toolset and I'll see what I can do to make your modding life suck less.

### Things I'm not supporting
Some things in the toolset I have absolutely no plans to support.
 - Mainline ME3Explorer. I do my all my work on my fork, and I will not support mainline ME3Explorer. If the issue is present in both upstream and mine, I will look into fixing it in my repository, but I do not submit pulls upstream. This fork is fully unaffiliated with upstream.
 - Texplorer, or anything really related to textures. If you want to do texture work, use [MassEffectModder](https://github.com/MassEffectModder/MassEffectModder). It's fast and actively maintained. I work with the developer regularly on the ALOT project.
 - Ancient tools such as Save Game Operator, or ones that are clearly experiments and are marked as deprecated.
 - Any platform besides PC. I have another fork of an old ME3Explorer build that can do extremely limited reading of package files from the Xenon (Xbox 360) build of MAss Effect 3 at https://github.com/Mgamerz/ME3Explorer-XENON.
 - Pirated user issues. If your game is pirated, don't bother asking for support if stuff is broken.
