	#region Summary
	/// <summary>
	/// <b>PActivity</b> controls some time dependent aspect of Piccolo, such
	/// as animation.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Once created activities must be scheduled with the PActivityScheduler
	/// managed by the PRoot to run. They are automatically removed from the
	/// scheduler when the animation has finished.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <example>
	/// There are several ways to be notfied of changes in an activity's state.  You can
	/// extend PActivity and override the <c>OnActivityStarted()</c>, <c>OnActivityStep()</c>, and
	/// <c>OnActivityFinished()</c> methods.  You can instantiate a PActivity and set its
	/// ActivityDelegate to a class that implements the PActivityDelegate interface methods
	/// (<c>ActivityStarted()</c>, <c>ActivityStepped()</c>, and <c>ActivityFinished()</c>).  Or,
	/// if you only wish to be notified of some of these changes you can directly set any of
	/// the individual delegates (<c>ActivityStarted</c>, <c>ActivityStepped</c> and
	/// <c>ActivityFinished</c>).  Each of these approaches are illustrated below:
