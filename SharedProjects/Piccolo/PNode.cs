        // Coordinate System Conversions - Methods for converting 
        // geometry between this nodes local coordinates and the other 
        // major coordinate systems.
        // 
        // Each nodes has a matrix that it uses to define its own coordinate
        // system. For example if you create a new node and add it to the
        // canvas it will appear in the upper right corner. Its coordinate
        // system matches the coordinate system of its parent (the root node)
        // at this point. But if you move this node by calling
        // node.TranslateBy() the nodes matrix will be modified and the node
        // will appear at a different location on the screen. The node
        // coordinate system no longer matches the coordinate system of its
        // parent. 
        //
        // This is useful because it means that the node's methods for 
        // rendering and picking don't need to worry about the fact that 
        // the node has been moved to another position on the screen, they
        // keep working just like they did when it was in the upper right 
        // hand corner of the screen.
        // 
        // The problem is now that each node defines its own coordinate
        // system it is difficult to compare the positions of two node with
        // each other. These methods are all meant to help solve that problem.
        // 
        // The terms used in the methods are as follows:
        // 
        // local - The local or base coordinate system of a node.
        // parent - The coordinate system of a node's parent
        // global - The topmost coordinate system, above the root node.
        // 
        // Normally when comparing the positions of two nodes you will 
        // convert the local position of each node to the global coordinate
        // system, and then compare the positions in that common coordinate
        // system.

        // Event Handlers - Methods for adding and removing event handler
        // delegates and event listener classes to and from a node.
        //
        // Here methods are provided to add property change handlers and input
        // event handlers. The property change handlers are notified when
        // certain properties of this node change, and the input event handlers
        // are notified when the node receives new key and mouse events.
        //
        // There are two ways to listen to input events.  One can use the
        // standard .NET approach of adding a handler method (delegate) to an
        // event for a given node.  For example, to listen for MouseDown events
        // on aNode, you could do the following.
        //
        // aNode.MouseDown += new PInputEventHandler(PNode_MouseDown);
        //
        // However, if you would like to add state to your event listeners and
        // the ability to filter events, then you will need to add an event
        // listener class.  You can use an existing one, or implement your own.
        // For example, to add a PZoomEventHandler to aNode, you could do the
        // following.
        //
        // aNode.AddInputEventListener(new PZoomEventHandler());
        //
        // See Piccolo.Events for more details.

        // Generally you will not need to call these invalidate methods 
        // when starting out with Piccolo because methods such as setPaint
        // already automatically call them for you. You will need to call

        // later discover this damage and report it to the Windows repaint manager.
